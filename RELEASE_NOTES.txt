    Version 2.3.1 (11/25/11 - external release)
	Added a Screen type, changed VM.screen from a dictionary to a
	Screen, added the VM.screens array, added a field named screen
	to all frames, dialogs and windows, and added documentation for
	VM (under the interpreter directory). The changes were added
	when multiple monitor support was included in the interpreter.
	See the new VM and Screen reference pages and the discussion
	of the screen field in all frame, dialog and window reference 
	pages for more details.

	---

	Added a field named fullscreen to Swing and AWT windows, frames,
	and dialogs. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added a "this block" to the named block variations. If there are
	two tokens in the variable name reference and the first is "this"
	then references to "this" in the block will refer to the compound
	object that's used for the block storage. For example, run the
	script

	    import yoix.*.*;

	    Dictionary dict = {
		int count = 10;
	    };

	    this dict {
		printf("count=%d\n", count);
		{
		    int count = 1;

		    printf("count=%d\n", count);
		    printf("this.count=%d\n", this.count);
		}
	    }

	and

	    count=10
	    count=1
	    this.count=10

	prints on standard output.

	---

	Modified the File type and some of the low level file related
	interpreter code so it now accepts Microsoft UNC pathnames in
	the format

	    //ComputerName/SharedFolder/Resource

	as a reference to a network resource. On a Windows platform
	you can also use the more familiar notation

	    \\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource

	to access the same resource. The low level changes were made
	in YoixMisc.toYoixpath() and those changes also affected the
	yoixPath() builtin. See the File and yoixPath reference pages
	for more details.

	---

	Added builtins named xmlToYoix() and yoixToXML() to yoix.parser
	that can be used to translate between an XML String and a Yoix
	structure built using dictionaries, arrays, and strings. See the
	reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added builtins named xmlAdd() and xmlGet() to yoix.parser that
	are often used to manipulate XML after xmlToYoix() converts it
	into an appropriate structure. See the reference pages for more
	details.

	---

	Made lots of improvements to the YWAIT package, including the
	addition of "edit components" that can be used when you want to
	support undo/redo operations and have immediate validation of
	all fields.

	---

	The current focus owner, if it's a Yoix component, can now be
	obtained using the new getFocusOwner() builtin that was added
	to yoix.awt and yoix.swing. See the reference page for more
	details.

	---

	Builtins named getFirstFocusComponent(), getFocusComponentAfter(),
	getFocusComponentBefore(), and getFocusComponents() were added
	to yoix.awt and yoix.swing and can be used to get information
	about focus traversal. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added a focusable field to all swing and awt components. Almost
	all components have their focusable field start at TRUE, which
	means they can accept the keyboard focus. Setting focusable to
	FALSE prevents the component from becoming the focus owner. See
	the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Modified the implementation the nextfocus field that's defined
	in most Swing components so the tag associated with a component
	can also be used. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added the --cookie, --cookies, and --cookiepolicy command line
	options that let you preload cookies and control how cookies
	received from the server are handled. All cookies set using
	these command line options must include a domain argument, but
	you don't get any warnings if there's a mistake or if you're
	using Java 1.5 where there's no cookie manager support. These
	new cookie options are included in the usage summary that you
	get with -? or --info command line options.

	NOTE - still lots of work to do before the CookieManager type
	would be worth documenting.

	---

	Added builtins named getScrollerSize() and getViewportSize() to
	yoix.swing that can be used to get the size of the scroller that
	the interpreter adds to some Swing components. See the reference
	pages for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named getSaturationAdjustedColor() to yoix.awt
	and yoix.swing. See the reference pages for more detail.

	---

	JScrollPane now accepts JScrollBars in the layout array when
	they're followed by the VERTICAL or HORIZONTAL constraints, so
	there's now a relatively simple way for scripts to control the
	JScrollPane. We also added extent, origin, and viewport fields
	to JScrollPane. See the JScrollPane and JScrollBar reference
	pages for more details.

	---

	Added a field named dividerlocked to JSplitPane, that can be
	temporarily used to stop the divider from moving when one or
	both of the displayed components is changed. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	XML numeric time zones, like -04:00, are now recognized by the
	date() and parseDate() builtins when an 'X' character is found
	in the format specification. See the documentation for more
	details.

	NOTE - the YoixSimpleDateFormat class was added to handle the
	low level details.

	---

	Made a small change to the behavior of the visible field in
	components, like JTextArea or JTable, that provide their own
	internal scroller that's managed by their scroll field. This
	version shows or hides the component and its internal scroller
	whenever the visible field is modified, which is a change from
	previous releases where the visible field only controlled the
	visibility of the component itself.

	---

	We modified the pathforall() builtin so it can also be called
	with a single function that handles all segment types. See the
	reference page for more details.

	---

	The access(), isDirectoryPath() and isFilePath() builtins were
	modified slightly so they now accept pathnames that begin with
	the "file:" prefix.

	---

	Added an optional third argument to strjoin() that when TRUE
	includes undefined elements (as empty strings) in the result.
	See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added an optional second argument to htmlEncode() that can be
	used to specify additional characters that should be encoded.
	See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added an optional int argument to the isBuiltin(), isCallable(),
	and isFunction() builtins and when that argument is supplied
	the builtins only return TRUE if call could be made with that
	number of arguments. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Made a simple change to GridBagLayout so it accepts an Insets
	and assigns it to the insets in the internal GridBagConstraints
	that are associated with columns. See the reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named zoom() to JCanvas. See the reference page
	for more details.

	---

	Added a function named allowEdit() to JTable that's called, if
	it's not NULL, before a cell can be changed by editing or the
	SET_FIELD action. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a function named afterSelect() to JTable that's called,
	if it's not NULL, whenever the JTable's selection changes. See
	the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added invokeEditImport() as a way for scripts to be notified
	when the edit cell changes because data was imported by a DnD
	operation or from a Clipboard. See the reference page for more
	details.

	---

	Added JTable cell editor specific actions named EDIT_GET_CELL,
	EDIT_GET_FIELD, EDIT_SET_FIELD, EDIT_SET_BACKGROUND, and
	EDIT_SET_FOREGROUND. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added GET_SELECTED_CELL as a JTable action. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added a field name sortmap to JTable that can be used to force
	one column to be sorted by the contents of another column that's
	usually hidden. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added selectionmark as a JTableColumn field that can be set to
	a string (e.g., "\x25BA") that you want automatically displayed
	in every row that's selected in that column. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added optional third and fourth elements in the JTableColumn's
	cellcolors array that can be used to control the background and
	foreground colors when a cell is selected. See the JTableColumn
	reference page for more details.

	NOTE - didn't make any changes to JTable's cellcolors array, but
	it's something we eventually should investigate.

	---

	Added EDIT_START documentation to the JTable reference page.

	---

	Modified the tooltiptext documentation for the SET_COLUMN_FIELD
	action to include array arguments, which are also allowed.

	---

	Added the missing documentation of JScrollPane's setIncrement()
	builtin.

	---

	Fixed the javaws YDAT examples that were accidentally broken in
	the last release. Problem happened because the variables.yx YDAT
	file was accidentally omitted from the javaws package that was
	installed on the web site.

	---

	Fixed the wikipedia edit history example that's included as one
	of our Java Web Start examples and distributed as a YDAT example
	in our binary distribution. The example broke when the HTML that
	it parses was changed in a way that made it completely miss the
	edit changes associated with all users. The fix was easy and the
	example is working again.

	===

	Fixed several bugs in the XML Parser that caused problems in how
	right brackets (i.e., ']') were handled in CHARDATA and CDATA.
	For example, the parser failed on "<tag>]</tag>" but worked if
	the ']' and '<' were separated by another character. The current
	solution was a brute force attempt at getting the right answer
	from the parser, but it can be expensive, particularly for input
	that contains CDATA, because each one now initially scans the
	remaining input. Eventually should look for a more efficient
	solution, particularly for CDATA. See Tests/BUGS/bug35.yx for a
	script that illustrates the behavior (in older versions of the
	interpreter).

	---

	Minor fix to YoixObject.getTransferData() that restricts callable
	pointer use to dictionaries. Had problem with a JCanvas that now
	seems to have paint() in slot 0.

	---

	If you don't tell Java's DataFlavor class what class loader to
	use it automatically uses the system class loader. That's usually
	OK, but the YWAIT client uses a URL loader to load the interpreter,
	which means the YoixDataTransfer can't create the DataFlavor used
	to represent a YoixObject. Fix was to use a different DataFlavor
	constructor in YoixDataTransfer.java that includes the appropriate
	class loader as an argument.

	---

	Added a consumed field to several events and also added code to
	YoixBodyComponent.java that initializes the field (based on the
	eventflags that can be set by command line option) right before
	an event handler is called. The field is checked after the call
	and if TRUE the event is officially consumed. None of this has
	been documented yet.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the low level implementation of xmlToYoix().
	Without the change the script

	    xml=@<<<page name="xxx"></page>>>@;
	    printf("%s\n", yoixToXML(xmlToYoix(xml, 0, TOSS_WS_CHARDATA)));

	would print something like

	    <page><name>xxx</name></page>

	which was obviously wrong.

	---

	Small change to low level implementation of yoixToXML(). Without
	the fix the script

	    xml=@<<<page name="xxx">12</page>>>@;
	    printf("%s\n", yoixToXML(xmlToYoix(xml, 0, TOSS_WS_CHARDATA)));

	would print

	    <page name="xxx"></page>

	which was obviously wrong.

	---

	Added trimtostroke() builtin to Path (and Graphics) that tries
	to eliminate overlapping segments from a path when it's stroked
	with the linewidth, linecap, and linejoin currently set in the
	Path. Not documented yet.

	---

	Looks like there was a mistake in setPage() that probably was
	introduced in a 2.3.0 bug fix. The bug that was introduced by
	the 2.3.0 change meant that reading a JTextPane's text field
	always returned HTML. The new fix changed the implementation
	of YoixBodyComponentSwing.setPage() when a NULL value was
	assigned to the field. We also changed how setPage() behaved
	when an exception was thrown while it was trying to load a
	URL. Finally we also changed the order of setField(N_PAGE)
	and setField(N_TEXT) in buildComponent() because Java threw
	an obscure exception when the page field was handled before
	the text field (if both fields were initialized to non NULL
	values).

	---

	Fixed a minor mistake in YoixParser.abort() that happened when
	it tried to adjust the column after an INVALIDASSIGNMENT error.
	The mistake was using text.length() instead of text.length()-1
	as the last character in the buffered line.

	---

	Added documentation for JLabel's altalignment field.

	---

	Fixed a bug to make sure that reading the file field defined in
	a JFileDialog with autodispose set to TRUE returns NULL after
	Cancel button is pressed. A related bug that was also fixed was
	to make sure that reading the file field after the Save button 
	was pressed returned the right value when autodispose is set to
	TRUE.

	---

	Made performance improvements to YoixBodyComponent.setLayout()
	that reduce overhead needed to sync components dictionaries.
	The old code is still available, but USENEWSETLAYOUT, which is
	defined in YoixBodyComponent.java must be set to false.

	---

	Added code to YoixBodyComponentSwing.java that handles integer
	prototype values for a JList and JComboBox, but decided not to
	document it, for now anyway, because we're not convinced by the
	implementation. There's a chance it will be removed in future
	releases, so we recommend that you don't write code that uses
	it.

	---

	Made a small change to the getTableCellRendererComponent()
	versions in YoixSwingJTable - when selection foregrounds or
	backgrounds are set via JTableColumns cellcolors field then
	a NULL entry for a row means cell's current background or
	foreground color is used. Last implementation treated NULL as
	a request to use the table's default selection background or
	or foreground. You now have to explicitly set it, which is
	mostly why the selectionbackground and selectionforeground
	changes described below were made (i.e., reading the fields
	now returns the appropriate default value when they haven't
	been explicitly set).

	---

	Changed YoixBodyComponentSwing so reading selectionbackground
	and selectionforeground return a Color that's obtained from
	the component (JTextComponent, JTable, and JTree) rather than
	returning the value stored in the data dictionary. There may
	be other fields that deserve similar changes - maybe later.

	---

	Fixed some of the annoying divider behavior in a JSplitPane
	that as far as I can tell can be traced back to Java's plaf
	code for the JSplitPane. There may be a bit more to do (see
	the comments in YoixSwingjSplitPane.java). Also added a field
	named keephidden to JSplitPane, but decided not to document
	it yet, which means applications shouldn't use it.

	---

	Added some growable support to several YoixMisc.copyIntoXXX()
	methods used it in YoixMiscXML.xmlToYoix(). Was done quickly
	and probably not very well, so the changes eventually should
	be looked at again.

	---

	Fixed a small bug in YoixSwingJComboBox.setSelectedItem() that
	only surfaced when a Yoix JComboBox was used as an editor in a
	JTable. The old code implicitly assumed the item was a String
	or null and only looked for a matching YoixSwingLabelItem when
	it was a string. The assumption was OK for all calls made from
	YoixBodyComponentSwing.java, but wasn't necessarily true when
	the JComboBox was a table cell editor. In that case the call

	    delegate.setValue(value);

	in YoixSwingJTable.java could end up in setSelectedItem() and
	the item argument might not be string. Wasn't a serious issue,
	but did mean a JCombBox editor might not be initialized using
	the table cell's current value.

	---

	Fixed a careless mistake in YoixBodyComponent.setForeground()
	that accidentally used the JTabbedPane's foreground color
	instead of the appropriate child's foreground color when it
	called syncTabProperty().

	---

	Just added code to YoixMain.java that enables the verifier in
	YoixMiscSSL.java, just like the -s0 option does, whenever the
	--acceptcertificates is used on the command line. The change
	means that hostname mistakes in any certificates will also be
	ignored.

	---

	Made a change in YoixModuleXColor.java so that the xcolor colors
	aren't automatically loaded into the Color dictionary. Means you
	now have explicitly call addColor() if you want xcolor colors to
	be loaded in the Color dictionary. Old approach meant an automatic
	expansion of the Color dictionary whenever the yoix.xcolor module
	was loaded, which was behavior that was really hard to explain.

	NOTE - this change may affect existing applications!!!

	---

	Changed the processKeyBinding() method in YoixSwingJTable.java to
	try to make sure focus never gets transferred to hidden columns.

	---

	Changed the KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED code in the processKeyBinding()
	method in YoixSwingJTable.java to make sure the keyChar is used
	in the event built for keyTyped() method that's defined in the
	YoixJTableCellEditor class. It was omitted in previous versions,
	which meant the call that's built for the invocationEditKey()
	handler didn't see the typed character if it was called from
	processKeyBinding(). Not all that important, but it was a mistake
	that could be observed when a JCheckBox editor was toggled by
	hitting the space key. 

	---

	Added a popuptrigger field to the InvocationEvent generated by a
	JTable and passed to invocationAction() and invocationSelection()
	event handlers. In practice it will only be non-zero on Windows
	systems because both event handlers are only called when a mouse
	button is released.

	---

	Added an explicit requestFocus() call to the setCellEditor()
	method defined in YoixSwingJTable.java when the cell editor is
	a JComboBox. Without the change the user has to click on a cell
	that uses a JComboBox as editor before it would respond to key
	strokes, which was annoying when the user wanted to only use the
	keyboard to handle focus traversal and cell editing.

	---

	Made a small change to the YoixJTableBooleanRenderer constructor
	defined in YoixSwingJTable.java so we can tell when it has the
	focus. Was a simple fix for annoying behavior that gave the user
	absolutely no indication that a table cell that used a JCheckBox
	as the cell editor had the focus.

	---

	Reading columns from a table sometimes resulted in attributes
	that wouldn't load when those columns were used to build a new
	table. There was inconsistent error handling in the code that
	handled attributes in the SET_COLUMN_FIELD and SET_TYPE_FIELD
	actions and the code that handled attributes that were defined
	in a Yoix JTableColumn (i.e., setColumn()). Two of the three
	aborted when an integer attribute wasn't positive, but the
	other (i.e., SET_COLUMN_FIELD) accepted all integers. Since
	aborting on 0 integers meant that columns read from a table
	might not be usable in the construction of another table, we
	decided to be more forgiving and accept all integers.

	---

	Modified documentation of the foreground and background fields
	in several Swing and AWT components so it reflects what really
	happens in the pickBackground() and pickForeground() methods
	defined in YoixBodyComponent.java.

	---

	Changed declaration of keychar from int to char in keyPressed(),
	keyReleased() and keyTyped() methods in YoixSwingJTable.java.
	Using an int version messed up the way the keystring field in
	was set in the event that was built for Yoix scripts.

	---

	Made several changes to YoixSwingJTable.java that make loading
	a table via text or values more consistent. The changes were
	in processColumn() and processValues() and only changes what
	happens when some column types (e.g., DATE_TYPE, DOUBLE_TYPE,
	INTEGER_TYPE, MONEY_TYPE, or TIME_TYPE) are asked to load empty
	strings (or null which shouldn't happen). The old implementation
	aborted, which didn't match what happens when empty strings are
	loaded via the text field.

	---

	Fixed an obscure bug in YoixJTableNumberRenderer.setFormatter()
	that in some cases resulted in the incorrect display of columns
	that displayed data that relies on a multiplier value that's not
	1 in the corresponding DecimalFormatter. Didn't happen often, so
	it's not something we've seen in existing Yoix applications, but
	it definitely was a bug that needed attention and it did happen
	in a new YWAIT application.

	---

	Made a few simple changes to the getTableCellRendererComponent()
	methods defined in various inner classes in YoixSwingJtable. The
	loops happened when the JTable's getBackground() returned null.
	Made similar changes to the code responsible for choosing the
	foreground color in the getTableCellRendererComponent() methods,
	even though we didn't observe any infinite loops caused by the
	foreground color.

	NOTE - loop appears to be thread related and wasn't reproducible,
	but the Java dump was very clear about where the code was stuck.

	---

	Fixed several small mistakes in getTableCellRendererComponent()
	that accidentally used the view row to select the appropriate
	color.

	---

	Made a simple change to YoixSwingJTable.checkAndSetValueAt()
	that eliminated invocationEdit() changes that were caused when
	the editor value was an empty string and the stored value was
	null.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the YoixSwingJTable.isCellEditable() method
	that used the view row argument it the getRowEditableBoolean()
	call, but that method expected a values row. The mistake caused
	problems when cell editability was set via arrays.

	---

	Added code to YoixSwingJTable.setCellEditor() to make sure the
	caret is visible when JTextField is the cell editor and the cell
	is entered by keyboard traversal.

	---

	Fixed the JTable GET_ROW_RECT and GET_COLUMN_RECT related code.
	Also modified TableDragGestureRecognized() in ywait_common.yx to
	fix the visual (and offset) that was used to represent the row
	that was being dragged. The mistakes in the original code can be
	seen in tables that are scrolled horizontally.

	NOTE - the JTable documentation of GET_COLUMN_RECT really looks
	like it need fixing - eventually will look into it.

	---

	Tried many of the available JavaCC versions, but had no luck with
	version 5.0, which is the latest version. The main problem appears
	to be in generated TokenMananager code where two private variables
	were converted to StringBuilders from StringBuffers but appropriate
	method arguments in the generated code weren't changed.

	=== TODO List ===

	Eventually may want to make the replace() builtin more flexible
	and accept a string as the first or second arguments. Definitely
	not urgent, but should be pretty easy and occasionally useful.

	---

	YoixSwingJTable.yoixConvertColumnIndexToModel() aborts when the
	the index is out of bounds. Doesn't seem to agree with the way
	the corresponding row methods behave. Why not return -1 when the
	index is bad? yoixConvertColumnIndexToView() also aborts. Think
	we eventually should investigate, but need to take a close look
	at how the return values are used in YoixSwingJTable.java before
	making any change.

	---

	Really seems like there should be a single JTable event handler
	that gets called whenever the contents of the edit cell change.
	Right now it looks like we need to use invocationEditKey() to
	capture key strokes, invocationEdit() to capture state changes
	when the edit cell is a JCheckBox (perhaps also when it's a
	JComboBox) and invocationEditImport() for DnD transfers. Also
	doesn't look like validator() can help at all when the script
	wants to be notified of every edit change because it's only
	called at the end of an edit!! Eventually investigate and see
	if things can be improved.

	---

	Was asked about table cell editing of DOUBLE_TYPE. Looks like
	the editor is loaded using Double.toString() (or something like
	it). That's OK, but isn't necessarily compatible with the value
	displayed by the cell if there's a format string. Can we improve
	the behavior? Experimented a bit, and it may be trickier than it
	seemed at first, because using the format string may not be the
	right approach and even if it is the result (e.g., if there are
	commas in the format) might not parse and/or the user may not
	exactly match the format. Need to think about it some. One
	possibility is a field (e.g., "editFormat") that can be used to 
	produce the string that's initially loaded in the cell editor.
	Need to think about it some - probably not urgent, but may be
	worth adding to the next release if it's not too tricky. See
	bug36.yx - even though it's really not a bug.

	---

	Is there something we can do so invocationChange() can tell if
	the event was triggered by the user or by the script? Perhaps
	we could add a field to the Yoix event.

	---

	There may be issues with reading/writing JTable's altfont after
	it is implicitly set once when an array of strings is used to
	set alttooltiptext.

    Version 2.3.0 (11/13/09 - external release)
	Added a type named Compiler to this release that can be used to
	translate Yoix functions or separate Yoix scripts into bytecode
	(actually Java class files is more accurate) that can run on the
	Java Virtual Machine. As a convenience we also added

	    VM.compiler

	so most Yoix applications don't need their own Compiler. See the
	Compiler reference page for more details.

	The compiler added to this release currently generates code in
	an assembly language that's recognized by the classes in package
	att.research.yoix.jvma (now officially part of the Yoix release)
	and translated into bytecode that runs on the JVM. The assembly
	language and other features of the att.research.yoix.jvma package
	have not been documented yet, so right now the source code is the
	only place to go if you're looking for more information.

	---

	The YWAIT client side Java code was completely rewritten and as
	a result the application's complete jar file no longer needs to
	be installed on client systems. Instead clients install a small
	jar file once and that jar file contacts CGI scripts on one or
	more servers that tell the client what it needs to download and
	how it is supposed to start the application. The real jar file
	is downloaded from a server and can optionally be cached on the
	client. Since the client side jar file no longer needs updating
	(unless hardcoded server information changes) we were also able
	to remove update support from all YWAIT screens and server side
	scripts.

	---

	Yoix scripts that are compressed using gzip can now be executed
	by the Yoix interpreter. In other words a gzipped script can be
	named on the command line, included using the include statement,
	or executed using the execute() builtin. We also added

	    VM.zipped

	as a read-only integer that controls whether gzipped scripts or
	the zipped archives created by the compiler can be executed. If
	bit 0 is set gzipped scripts can be executed and if bit 1 is set
	zipped archives (i.e., compiled scripts) can be executed. Right
	now the default value is 1 and the -z option is the only way to
	change it, so add -z2 or -z3 to the command line used to start
	the interpreter whenever you want to execute compiled scripts.

	---

	Added a field named trackfocus to JTabbedPane that can help if
	you want the focus to be managed by the individual tabbed panes.
	See the reference page for more details.

	---

	We added a field named firstfocus to JDialog, JFrame, JWindow,
	JInternalFrame, Dialog, Frame, and Window. See the reference
	pages for more details and a brief description of how focus
	selection is handled the first time a window is shown.

	---

	Fixed a bug that prevented a JList from being cleared when NULL
	was assigned to its labels or items fields.

	---

	Changed the default buttonmodel back to 0, which is the way it
	was prior to the 2.2.1 release. The change was made because at
	least one Mac user complained, it only affected Mac users, and
	it restored buttonmodel to the release 2.2.0 setting, which for
	years was the default setting.

	---

	Fixed the wikipedia edit history example that's included as one
	of our Java Web Start examples and distributed as a YDAT example
	in our binary distribution. The example broke when the HTML that
	it parses was changed in a way that made it completely miss the
	edit changes associated with all users. The fix was easy and the
	example is working again.

	---

	Even though drag and drop in JLists works it doesn't behave well
	when multiple selections are involved because a mouse press used
	to start a drag changes the list's selected items. The dndlist.yx
	script included in our examples builds a component that a behaves
	like JList but was designed to do a better job handling drag and
	drop. It can be used as a prototype if you need drag and drop and
	multiple selections in a component that behaves something like a
	JList. It was written in a style that should let you include the
	main parts as one of the YWAIT constructors.

	===

	Fixed a JTable bug that prevented the SET_FIELD from changing
	some fields that weren't initialized when the table was loaded.
	Also fixed several JTable bugs that happened when table sorting
	and cell editing were combined.

	---

	Fixed a bug in the JTable cell validation code that could result
	in an infinite loop if the JTable validator() function returned
	false. We also modified the JTable code so the cell validator()
	is called with NULL as the post-edit or pre-edit arguments when
	we want to indicate an empty cell. Unfortunately this currently
	doesn't apply to STRING_TYPE, TEXT_TYPE, or OBJECT_TYPE cells!!

	---

	Fixed a JTextPane bug in YoixBodyComponentSwing that prevented
	the correct display of HTML when it was set via the text field.
	The fix was adding

	    ((JTextPane)comp).setEditorKit(new YoixHTMLEditorKit());

	to the YoixBodyComponentSwing.setPage() method. Also looks like
	there's an issue with style sheets hanging around after reading
	a Web site via the page field and then switching to using text
	to display HTML.

	Made a quick try at changing the YoixBodyComponentSwing.setText()
	method so a new document and editor were installed when in HTML
	mode. Sort of worked, but the result (initially) depended on the
	order of the

		setField(N_PAGE);
		setField(N_TEXT);

	calls made in buildComponent(). Flipping their order seemed
	reasonable, but decided the interactions between the text and
	page fields need a closer look and probably a more disciplined
	fix - later.

	---

	Fixed a deadlock in the YDAT DataManager.java class file that
	was related to the thread-safe Swing implementation that was
	introduced in version 2.2.0.

	---

	Made several low level YDAT changes that fixed the behavior
	of shapes drawn from a single specification but used to mark
	more than one location on a map. Old implementation included
	all the marks in a single path, which didn't work when each
	of the marks is supposed to identify a separate location on
	a map at any zoom level.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the gsubsti() and gvsubsti() builtins that
	could result in an infinite loop when "^" or "$" were used as
	the pattern. Fixed another mistake that caused gsubsti() and
	gvsubsti() to occasionally make incorrect substitutions in the
	interior of target strings when the matched pattern explicitly
	restricted substitutions to the start of the string using "^".

	=== TODO List ===

	Eventually should add opposite to FocusEvent. Also think there
	should be a way to completely remove an event listener so Java
	doesn't forward them. removeEventhandler() doesn't do anything
	more than setting the event handler to NULL, so the events all
	still get forwarded to YoixBodyComponent(). Think it could do
	more, but the implementation might be a little tricky.

	---

	Looks like Calendar.set() doesn't ever clear milliseconds, so
	unixtime fields may not compare the way you expect after using
	Calendar.set(). Investigate and see if there's an easy fix.

	---

	Added YoixSwingJFormattedTextField.java to the source code but
	it's incomplete, not included in the Makefile, and obviously
	not hooked up as a Swing component. It's probably worthwhile
	and eventually should be finished and documented.

    Version 2.2.1 (11/25/08 - external release)
	We modified the interpreter so Java Web Start can start it as
	an "untrusted" application, added several ".jnlp" file to our
	web site that run some non-trivial examples (e.g., Periodic
	Table and Unicode applications), and created a web page that
	describes the Java Web Start examples and includes links that
	that you can click to start the examples.

	---

	Added support for a system splash screen that can be shown
	using the --splash option or the showSystemSplashScreen()
	builtin and hidden by the hideSystemSplashScreen() builtin,
	both of which are defined in the yoix.system module. See the
	reference pages for information about the builtins. Use -?
	or --info for a summary of the command line options.

	---

	Added a field named shape to JFrame, JDialog, JWindow, Frame,
	Dialog, and Window, that can be used to create non-rectangular
	windows, provided you're using Java 1.6.0 update 10 (or later).
	See the reference pages for more details.

	NOTE - we eventually will add support for transparent windows.

	---

	Added a field named decorationstyle to Frame, Dialog, JFrame,
	and JDialog that can be used to control the decorations that
	are usually added to frames and dialogs.

	NOTE - non-rectangular frames and dialogs, which require Java
	1.6.0 update 10 (or later), must always disable native window
	decorations using this field. See the reference pages for more
	details.

	---

	Added SpringLayout as a new layout manager. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named getResource() to yoix.system that's mostly
	for javaws applications. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Changed getRGBColor() so it also accepts a string or int as the
	representation of the red, green and blue components. See the
	reference page for more details.

	---

	Changed the -g command line option slightly so the function call
	trace that was a standard part of errors in previous releases now
	only happens when you use the -g:trace option. Also added -g:none,
	which right now behaves just like the -O option.

	---

	Added a module named yoix.jnlp that contains several builtins
	that are available when the Yoix interpreter is started by Java
	Web Start. The currently supported builtins are showDocument()
	and isWebBrowserSupported() - see the reference pages for more
	details.

	NOTE - additional builtins will be added in future releases.

	---

	Changed default VM.buttonmodel to 1, which only changes modifiers
	if you're on a Mac, the CTRL key is held, and button 1 is pressed,
	which can be useful if you're using a one button mouse.

	===

	Fixed an obscure mistake in our handling of the layout array
	that's defined in all Swing and AWT containers that failed to
	propagate changes made to a layout array that was at least one
	level removed from the root container in an existing layout
	hierarchy.

	---

	Fixed the mouse wheel code in YoixMakeEvent.java that resulted
	in accidentally keeping a reference to components that received
	MouseWheelEvents for a bit longer than necessary. The reference
	sometimes delayed garbage collection of components until another
	mouse wheel events arrived and that behavior made it look like
	a memory leak.

	---

	We changed quit handling in the YWAIT ywait_reconnect.yx and
	ywait_reconnect_password.yx screens and the change seems to
	have fixed the hang that happened when users pressed "Quit"
	in either reconnect screen. Change was tested in GFMS and in
	EPG, but we probably should build a YWAIT application from the
	current source and test it. Also might be better if we dealt
	with this in Global.Quit using a new thread allocated in the
	ywait_threads.yx file.

	---

	Made some minor quoting changes to the scripts that are built
	when you run the Yoix installer that should address problems
	that users occasionally report.

	---

	Made a few changes in the interpreter that will let Java 1.4.2
	start the interpreter and run some Yoix scripts. Mostly done so
	users with old versions of Java will be able to run our Java Web
	Start examples.

	=== TODO List ===

	Setting font magnification on the command line doesn't behave
	particularly well for JProgressBar, so we eventually may want
	to investigate.

	---

	A user wanted to to hide tabs in a JTabbedPane by setting the
	visible field, which currently doesn't work but seems perfectly
	reasonable. A brute force approach (replacing the layout array)
	works, but the visible approach would be much better. The same
	user also wanted to move tabs around, but in this case replacing
	the layout array is undoubtedly the easiest way.

	---

	Had a suggestion about adding := as an assignment operator that's
	also a declaration (the way Limbo does).

    Version 2.2.0 (8/26/08 - external release)
	A Yoix script specified on the command line that has a name that
	ends in the suffix ".yxs" is now automatically run as an applet,
	which means it is run with limited capabilities that pretty much
	duplicate the restrictions imposed on a Java applet by a browser.
	In other words, running a script that ends in .yxs is essentially
	like adding --applet as last command line option. As usual, you
	can always expand what's allowed when you run a .yxs script using
	one or more -S command line options.

	NOTE - as a precaution any script specified on the command line
	that contains control characters or ".yxs" anywhere in its name
	is also run as an applet. This special treatment of script names
	currently only happens at startup, which means it doesn't apply
	to scripts that are executed or included by a running Yoix script.

	NOTE - information about command line options can be obtained by
	typing

	    yoix -?

	which writes a short explanation on standard output, or

	    yoix --info

	which gives you more a more detailed explanation.

	---

	We've included several interesting (and non-trivial) examples of
	interactive charts that were built using a script named ychart.yx
	and a special module named ychart that's included in this release.
	One example is a "Periodic Table" that also includes a puzzle and
	a fairly simple "Chart of the Nuclides". The second example is a
	chart that displays Unicode characters, which by default loads the
	first 16K characters, but is capable of displaying the first 64K in
	a single chart (i.e., Plane 0 of the official Unicode standard). We
	think you'll find both examples interesting, even if you're not a
	chemistry student or typographer.

	In addition to the practical examples we've included a few trivial
	charts that illustrate techniques needed to apply ychart.yx to new
	examples. Right now getting something simple up is fairly easy, but 
	really interesting examples like the two we're distributing in this
	release still take quite a bit of planning and Yoix coding.

	---

	One of the consequences of ychart.yx and our attempt at generality
	is that we were really forced to start working on a tutorial, so in
	this release you'll find a fairly substantial first cut at

	    http://www.yoix.org/tutorial.html

	It's not complete (we figure it's about half of what's needed), but
	it does cover many topics you need if you're curious and decide to
	start poking around in ychart.yx. Our plans are to continue working
	on the tutorial and we probably will update the online version from
	time to time without necessarily waiting for the next release.

	---

	We added some new Java code that we think makes our implementation
	of Swing thread-safe, and that means Yoix applications don't have
	to worry about only accessing fields in Swing components from the
	"event dispatch thread". The thread-safe code can be disabled from
	the command line using the --threadsafe=false option (it's true by
	default). We also added two builtins named setSwingThreadSafe() and
        getSwingThreadSafe() to yoix.swing that scripts can use when they
	want to change the threadsafe setting, provided it wasn't set by a
	command line option.

	NOTE - we haven't extended the threadsafe code to the YDAT module
	yet, but we don't think it's much of an issue so we figure it can
	wait for the next release (or so).

	---

	We added an integer field named panandzoom to JCanvas that can be
	used to enable automatic panning and zooming. Callback functions
	named afterPan() and afterZoom() that are occasionally useful were
	also added. Panning and zooming are controlled by separate groups
	of eight bits in panandzoom. For example,

	    JFrame f = {
		int visible = TRUE;

		Array layout = {
		    new JCanvas {
			int panandzoom = 0x000401;

			paint(Rectangle rect) {
			    graphics.moveto(100, 100);
			    graphics.show("hello, world");
			}
		    },
		};
	    };

	is a trivial "hello, world" example that lets you zoom using the
	mouse wheel and pan using button 1. The third group of eight bits
	can be configured when you want to provide "reset" control using
	mouse buttons. See the JCanvas reference page for more details.

	---

	We finally corrected a long-standing oversight. In all previous
	releases dictionaries could be initialized by comma separated
	expressions enclosed in braces, but only if the dictionary name
	was followed by square brackets. It was an annoying restriction
	that has been removed, so in this release all three declarations

	    Dictionary d1 = {"count", 1, "greeting", "hello"};
	    Dictionary d2[] = {"count", 1, "greeting", "hello"};
	    Dictionary d3[2] = {"count", 1, "greeting", "hello"};

	are allowed and they create dictionaries that contain identical
	elements, namely an integer named count that has the value 1 and
	a string named greeting that has the value "hello".

	---

	We modified the grammar slightly so the final qualifier can now be
	attached to function definitions. For example,

	    final Countdown(int count) {
		for (; count > 0; count--) {
		    printf("%d%s", count, count > 1 ? ", " : "\n");
		    sleep(1);
		}
	    }

	defines a function named Countdown that can't be changed because
	we used final in its definition. In case you're a bit surprised,
	Yoix functions behave just like variables and by default they can
	be redefined or even set to NULL. Allowing the final keyword in
	a function definition is an easy way to prevent redefinitions, if
	that's really what you want.

	---

	If a syntax error occurs on a line that doesn't match the starting
	line number of the statement the parser was working on then we add
	the line number where the statement started to the error message.
	For example, typing in an obvious mistake like

	    if (VM != NULL) {
	        x = 12;
	        y;
	    else

	results in something like

	    Error: syntaxerror; Encountered: "else"; Line: 4; Column: 1;
	                                    Start Line: 1; Source: -stdin-

	being printed (as a single line) on standard error. In addition
	most errors generated by the parser (e.g., a syntaxerror) also
	display the source file line where the error happened and use a
	caret to mark the column where the parser noticed the mistake.

	We also changed the error identification string that you get when
	you declare a variable that already exists from "baddeclaration"
	to "redeclaration".

	---

	We made a change to our implementation of catch that now treats a
	missing return value just like a non-zero return, so in both cases
	the interpreter's normal error handling is short-circuited. In all
	previous releases the interpreter would continue its normal error
	handling if there was no explicit return value from a catch block.

	NOTE - there's a small chance this change that will affect some
	existing applications, although the only case that we found was
	in an unimportant catch block in our YWAIT package.

	---

	Changed qsort() and the queue() and queueOnce() builtins defined
	in Thread so they all now accept a pointer to a function as an
	argument. Also qsort(), which didn't return anything in previous
	releases, now returns the sorted items array. See the Thread and
	qsort() reference pages for more details.

	---

	We made some internal changes to our implementation of copyArea()
	builtin and we added corresponding builtins named rectcopy() and
	rectmove() to Graphics. See the copyArea() and Graphics reference
	pages for more details.

	---

	We added builtins named rectContainsRect(), rectIntersectionRect(),
	rectIntersectsRect(), and rectUnionRect() to yoix.module.graphics.
	See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	We added a builtin named getenv() to yoix.system and we also added
	checkReadEnvironment() to our SecurityManager. See the reference
	pages for more details.

	---

	We added builtins named parseURL(), isMCGlobal(), isMCLinkLocal(),
	isMCNodeLocal(), isMCOrgLocal(), isMCSiteLocal() and isReachable()
	to yoix.net. Most of them were added to java.net.InetAddress in
	version 1.4. We also changed getAllByName() slightly to let you
	request that the addresses be returned in network byte order. See
	the reference pages for more details.

	---

	We added builtins named cbrt(), cosh(), expm1(), hypot(), iround(),
	ieeeRemainder(), log1p(), round(), signum(), sinh(), tanh(), ulp(),
	toDegrees(), and toRadians() to yoix.math. Most of them correspond
	to methods that were added to java.lang.Math in version 1.5. See
	the reference pages for more details.

	---

	We added builtins named checkRead(), checkWrite(), checkDelete(),
	checkAccept(), checkConnect(), checkListen(), checkMulticast(),
	checkPropertiesAccess(), checkReadProperty(), checkWriteProperty(),
	checkReadEnvironment(), checkSystemClipboardAccess(), checkExec(),
	checkExit(), checkReadDisplayPixels(), and checkCreateRobot() to
	yoix.system that can be used to run security checks that don't
	trigger security exceptions. See the reference pages for more
	details.

	---

	Added drawablebbox() and rectbutton() builtins to Graphics. See
	the Graphics reference page for more details.

	---

	Added maptopixel() builtin to Graphics and Matrix. Although the
	builtin may accept more than a Point as a single argument we have
	only documented the Point version so that's all you should use.
	See the Graphics or Matrix reference pages for more details.

	---

	We added intersects() and eointersects() to Graphics and Path and
	modified add() intersect(), subtract() and xor() to take a Path,
	Rectangle, or NULL as their first argument. See the Graphics and
	Path reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added an optional argument to clip(), eoclip() and rectclip() that
	controls whether path is intersected with or subtracted from the
	current clipping path. See the Graphics reference page for more
	details.

	---

	Added an optional argument to stroke(), fill() and eofill() that
	can be used to prevent path from being tossed after it's stroked
	or filled. See the Graphics reference page for more details.

	---

	Added an optional int argument to the repaint() builtin defined
	in the drawable Swing components JCanvas, JDesktopPane, JDialog,
	JFileDialog, JFrame, JInternalFrame, JLayeredPane, JPanel, and
	JWindow. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added fields named prototypevalue and selectedindex to JComboBox
	and JList. We also provide an easy way, using the items field, to
	load images along with text. See the JComboBox and JList reference
	pages for more details.

	---

	We added unitstoscroll and whennext fields to MouseWheelEvents.
	We also added an integer field named eventflags to VM and we use
	it to decide how to calculate unitstoscroll. When bit 0 is 0 we
	just multiply the wheelrotation and scrollamount fields in the
	MouseWheelEvent and store the result in our unitstoscroll field,
	otherwise we use a fancier algorithm that tries to pick a value
	that's appropriate for all platforms. See the MouseWheelEvent
	reference page for more details.

	---

	JSplitPane's dividerlocation field now always returns a number
	between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive when the field is read.

	---

	We added fields named linecap, linejoin, linewidth, and miterlimit
	to Path that can be used to control the behavior of the instroke()
	builtin that's define in a Path. See the Path reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added builtins named stringfit() and stringsize() and fields named
	fontfacename and psname to Font. See the Font reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named hashIndex() to yoix.util. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named getHSBComponents() to yoix.swing and yoix.awt
	that returns the HSB color components that correspond a RGB color.
	See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Made a to the access() builtin so that executablilty of a file can
	be accurately checked when Java 1.6 is being used.

	===

	We made some changes in YoixSecurityOptions.java for the accept,
	connect, and listen actions and as a result they now automatically
	use InetAddress.getAllByName() to try to assign the same allow or
	deny permissions to all IP addresses that are assigned to a host.
	To qualify for the special treatment the pattern specified using
	the -S command line option can't include '*' and also must specify
	a host and a port (separated by a ':'). For example,

	    yoix -Sallow:connect:www.google.com:80

	lets you connect to port 80 using www.google.com or any of the IP
	addresses that are assigned to www.google.com. Without the change
	you would also have to allow connections to the IP addresses using
	separate -S options. Definitely inconvenient, particularly because
	you probably don't know which IP address you'll get when you try
	to open http://www.google.com.

	---

	Fixed an apparent mistake in the implementation of the defined()
	builtin that affected the lookup when an integer was supplied as
	the first argument and the target was an object, like an array or
	dictionary, with a nonzero offset. The mistake in our Java code
	was that it didn't add the target's offset to the integer, but
	instead just used the integer to find the element to check.

	---

	We changed the actionPerformed() and itemStateChanged() methods
	in YoixBodyComponent.java to try and skip double calls that can
	happen in Swing menus that have their own event handlers but the
	"owner" of the menu also has defined one or both of them. There's
	a very small chance this could affect existing applications, but
	we don't think it's likely.

	---

	We now compensate for a Swing popup menu problem that apparently
	introduced in Java 1.6. The problem happened when a popup menu
	doesn't fit completely in the window that's supposed to contain
	it and a security manager is installed. The issue, we believe, is
	that the setAlwaysOnTop(true) call triggers a security exception
	in the AWT Window class so Java's Popup class should either catch
	the exception or make the call as privileged code. We compensated
	in YoixSecurityManager.checkPermission() with a small kludge that
	seems to work and we think is otherwise fairly innocent.

	---

	YoixInterpreter.statementSynchronized() always built a string that
	was only used for special debugging, and in most cases building it
	involved a Yoix object dump which in turn automatically triggered
	sorting for object like dictionaries. If a big dictionary was used
	for synchronization the unnecessary sorting overhead could add up
	and become noticeable if the synchronized statement was executed
	often. Anyway, we no longer dump the Yoix object and we only build
	the debugging string when the special debugging mode is enabled.

	---

	We fixed a low level mistake in our Java code that affected popup
	menus that were attached to a JComboBox on a Mac.

	---

	Fixed a mistake that sometimes affected how the linewidth, linejoin,
	linecap, miterlimit, dasharray, and dashphase fields were treated
	by gsave() and grestore().

	---

	We made it so custom values can be added to Graphics. Change was in
	YoixModuleGraphics.java and may need testing.

	---

	We added some public methods to YoixBodyInterpreter.java that are
	designed to let custom module code look for variables the way Yoix
	scripts currently do. We used them when we converted Yoix functions
	defined in ychart.yx to the corresponding Java methods defined in
	the ychart module.

	---

	Added the fontDrawString() method to YoixInterfaceFont.java so we
	could pass a Java Graphics object directly to it from Java code.
	This was mostly done for custom modules, like ychart.

	---

	Changed YoixBodySwingComponent.buildLabelItems() so an empty array
	assigned to items, values, or mappings behave just like NULL. Got
	an error in the old version because the method tried to get the
	element at index 0 in the array.

	---

	Changed YoixMiscJFC.paintBackground() so it no longer casts its
	Graphics object to Graphics2D. The casting caused problems when
	paintBackground() was called to paint into a Graphics object that
	was specifically allocated by Java for printing. Happened on Linux
	and resulted in a Java exception.

	---

	Made a small change to YoixBodyPath.pathSetShape() that fixes an
	occasional problem that happened when the shape argument was an
	area that was empty. See comments in YoixBodyPath.pathSetShape()
	and YoixBodyGraphics.builtinClipPath() for more details.

	---

	We made several code changes in YoixBodyComponent.updateRoot() and
	YoixBodyComponentSwing.doMenuLayout() to fix a mistake that omitted
	updating the root in child menus when a new value was assigned to
	a JMenu's items field.

	---

	Made several subtle changes to YoixBodyPath.pathStrokePath() that
	improve the performance and output when the path's matrix has been
	scaled uniformly. See the comments in the method for more info.

	---

	Made a small change to YoixSwingJCanvas.setState() that eliminates
	unnecessary repaint() calls when the state changes and the canvas
	doesn't have a border. Important because setState() can be called
	from most of the YoixSwingJCanvas.java MouseListener methods, and
	that resulted unnecessary painting in an early version of ychart.

	---

	Made a small change in YoixInterpreter.statementTry() so the error
	message that we get when a Yoix script catches a securityerror will
	include information that's available in the Java exception. The old
	implementation didn't include any information that might help track
	down and resolve the problem.

	---

	This release changed definition of JAVACTARGET in file common.mk to
	1.5 from 1.2 and it's that change and the JAVAMINVERSION definition
	in YoixConstants.java that means you can't use Java version 1.4.2
	to start the Yoix interpreter. We really don't recommend it, but if
	for some reason you have to run Java 1.4.2 you could try changing
	JAVACTARGET and JAVAMINVERSION and then building a yoix.jar file
	using Java 1.5 or Java 1.6. The resulting file probably would let
	you run on 1.4.2, although new features that require 1.5 or greater
	will definitely cause problems (i.e., Java runtime errors).

	=== TODO List ===

	There's a layout bug (for all containers including menus) that's
	illustrated by bug19.yx. We've investigated the problem and have
	a possible solution that we plan on implementing in the very near
	future (hopefully in our next release).

	---

	Looks like our qsort() could use improvement when it's asked to
	sort a dictionary with lots of uninitialized elements. It takes
	a long time, but seems like it should be a relatively easy fix.

	---

	The repaint() builtin defined in Swing and AWT components can use
	some work. It currently doesn't implement arguments that let you
	specify the rectangle that's supposed to be painted.

	---

	Java's JComboBox.setSelectedIndex() method might be a source of
	unnecessary work, since we seem to have the index but it ends up
	calling setSelectedItem() anyway. We eventually may investigate
	more, but it's probably not a big deal.

	---

	May want to check the methods in YoixModuleGraphics.java that use
	getInt() and see if getDouble() could be used and if so is it a
	better choice. Many eventually have to pass integers to methods
	in java.awt.Graphics, so there's probably not much to change.

	---

	Check YDAT Java code to see if it needs the threadsafe update.

	---

	We eventually want to let square brackets be used in declarations
	of objects, like a Rectangle, which would be an easy way to make a
	copy of the object (without resorting to unroll()). Place to start
	probably is in YoixMake.yoixType(). Changing the line

	    } else if (type.isPointer() && length < 0) {

	in YoixMake.yoixType() to

	    } else if (type.isPointer() && (length < 0 || adjust)) {

	doesn't accomplish much but may be a reasonable place to start. We
	may initially want to restrict this to empty square brackets.

	---

	Added a questionable argument to the pathbbox() builtin that's not
	documented and really needs to be revisited. Right now the argument
	is used in ychart.yx, but it shouldn't be used anywhere else and
	may be removed in a future release. Obviously we'll have to fix
	ychart.yx if that ever happens. Anyway we should take a close look
	before the next release. Issue had to do with marking the canvas
	and then slowly scrolling up and down with the mark at the top of
	the screen. Occasionally part of it would be omitted, but we had
	to scroll (i.e., pan) slowly.

	---

	Path defines a paint() function that is currently undocumented and
	right now is only called, if it's defined, right at the end of the
	constructor. Apparently designed to help with initialization, but
	we're not convinced. Eventually should investigate and either toss
	it or document it.

	---

	Looks like break and continue don't work properly when used in a
	try/catch statement. Actually we fixed try blocks on 8/8/08, but
	catch was harder and we didn't want to hold the release up, so we
	pushed it into the next release.

	---

	Should we try to do something with exampleserver.yx, like revive
	it as a .yxs script? Suspect not but probably should be checked.

    Version 2.1.10 (11/28/07 - external release)
	Added BUILTIN_GETSEARCHQUERY builtin to ydat/DataGenerator.java
	so search string queries can be easily extracted. Thought about
	adding a way to do it with BUILTIN_MATCH, but already had a few
	httpd log specific builtins and didn't seem like one more would
	hurt. Eventually may want a BUILTIN_GETMATCH, or something like
	it, to return matched dsubexpressions.

	---

	Added an AUTO_PATTERN type to Regexp that will act as either a
	text or a shell pattern based on absence or presence of shell
	wild cards and character classes in the pattern. Rudimentary
	ORing of patterns is also allowed.

	---

	Changed YoixMisc.tokenImage() so POSTINCREMENT and PREINCREMENT
	return "++" and POSTDECREMENT and PREDECREMENT return "--". In
	the old implementation the constants weren't mapped to token
	strings so we just got long strings like "POSTINCREMENT".

	---

	Added "uniform spread" capabilities to YDAT plots (not stacks).

	---

	Fixed an apparent mistake in reading the timezone field in a
	Calendar. Easy fix that's undoubtedly correct, but the old way
	also seemed like it would work - probably should investigate a
	bit before the next release.

	---

	Changed handling of the typename attribute so it works when the
	lvalue is unreadable. Think this is the only remaining attribute
	that deserves the change.

	---

	Backed out the YoixSwingJComboBox.setSelectedItem() change made
	in 2.1.9 because it introduced occasional sizing problems and
	instead we now call repaint() at the end of setSelectedItem().
	Also dealt with a setFont() issue in YoixSwingJComboBox.java
	that seemed to happen because changing the font doesn't clear
	both size caches and as a result the getPreferredSize() that's
	implemented in Sun's plaf/basic/BasicComboBoxUI.java might not
	notice that the font changed.

	---

	Trivial change to yoix.mk to make the clobber target work with
	Sun's default make and their /bin/sh.

	---

	Improved the printf/fprintf/strfmt handling of double values
	displayed using the %d specification. In particular, doubles
	less than 1e-15 of a whole number are displayed as that whole
	number rather than being rounded down and double values outside
	the (Java-valued) range [Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE] are
	displayed as a sequence of asterisks (use %g or %f rather than
	%d to display doubles if you want to avoid the asterisks).

	---

	Corrected the viewrowcount in JTable for the case where a table
	has multi-line rows.

	---

	Fixed some menu background color issues that were observed under
	Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).

	---

	In JTable, focus loss in a cell no longer terminates editing.

    Version 2.1.9 (9/28/07 - external release)
	JTable now supports a new column type called TEXT_TYPE, which
	uses a JTextPane to display and edit the data, thus multi-line
	cells and cells containing HTML can be included in a table.

	---

	Yoix scripts providing some business graphics functionality
	are now available for download from the Yoix web site (look
	for the BYZGRAF links). In addition, the functionality is
	also available to YWAIT applications.

	---

	A subtext built-in was added to all Swing text components to
	facilitate extraction of a subset of text. In the case of text
	that contains formatting directives, such as HTML, it provides
	a way to get text with directives stripped out (unlike using
	the text field, which would include those directives).

	---

	JTextPane now includes an alignment field and is also more
	responsive to the background, foreground and font fields.
	Explicit settings in formatted text, such as HTML, still
	take precedence, but these fields can now set the default
	values and also can affect lines of text within the current
	selection or at the caret position.

	---

	Our JTextPane RTF behavior has been improved. In particular,
	binary RTF can now be loaded into and extracted from the
	component using the text field.

	---

	Made some changes to the low level TitledBorder font and color
	code in YoixMakeScreen.java that make sure the look and feel
	settings win when no font or background are specified for the
	border.

	---

	The low level color support code now looks at the fields in
	a Yoix Color object and calculates the actual field values
	differently depending on whether it finds an integer or a
	double. The addColor(), getBrighterColor(), getCMYKColor(),
	getDarkerColor(), getHSBColor(), and getRGBColor() builtins
	were also modified to behave differently when an integer or
	double is passed as a color component argument. Take a look
	at the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added a mechanism that lets Yoix scripts align menubar items
	to the right side of the menubar. See the JMenuBar reference
	page for more details.

	===

	Made some small changes to the order that things were done in
	YoixBodyProcess.stopProcess() that make sure Yoix scripts can't
	accidentally use the three streams associated with a process
	that's been officially killed.

	---

	Made a small change in YoixSwingJComboBox.setSelectedItem() to
	make sure it runs in the event thread. Done because a user of
	a large Yoix application had problems with the label painting
	properly in a non-editable JComboBox.

    Version 2.1.8 (8/28/07 - external release)
	The line number information in many error messages has been
	improved. We also added a command line option (i.e., --trace)
	that can be used to request a trace of the call stack when an
	error occurs. The option is automatically enabled when you use
	the -g option and it can also be controlled from a Yoix script
	using the VM.trace field. Information about all command line
	options can be obtained using the -? or --info options.

	---

	We also added a --lookandfeel command line that lets you pick
	a look and feel using the command line or a property file entry.
	As usual, more information about all command line options can
	be obtained using the -? or --info options.

	---

	Several low level debugging flags that could be set using the
	-d command line option or VM.debug were removed or moved. Most
	of the changes were to obscure flags that were rarely used, so
	we doubt anyone will notice these changes.

    Version 2.1.7 (8/15/07 - external release)
	We did lots of work trying to tame the behavior of screens that
	contain JScrollPanes, which sometimes misbehave when the screen
	is resized. The behavior of the algorithm that we're now using
	can be controlled by a special field named sizecontrol that we
	added to JScrollPane and the Swing components, like JList and
	JTextArea, that normally provide their own scrolling support.
	The default values assigned to sizecontrol in components that
	support the field seem to result in very good behavior, so for
	now we're not going to document the sizecontrol field. If you
	think you need to use it please let us know and at that point
	we'll provide appropriate documentation.

	---

	Added SWEEPGRAPHS to YDAT. Also added a monitor thread that can
	be automatically kicked off by setting MONITORTHREAD to TRUE in
	config files. Assigning a positive number to MONITORTHRESHOLD,
	which can also be done in config files, means the monitor thread
	will only start if the number of bytes in the input data exceeds
	that number. You can take a snapshot of any YDAT data screen and
	there's a popup menu available in the snapshot screen that will
	let you draw on the snapshot and toggle its size (also done by
	double clicking). We included a simple example of a "histograph",
	in which nodes in a graph are colored the way bars in a histogram
	are, which is the behavior that's illustrated by an old example
	on our website. Finally, the same filter/search panel that comes
	with YWAIT tables now automatically appears on all SWEEPTABLES
	and the appearance of various buttons and labels is controlled
	by the variables

		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_DND
		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_EXPORT
		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_FILTER
		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_RESET
		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_ROWINFO
		SHOW_SWEEPTABLE_SEARCH

	which can be set to TRUE or FALSE in a config file.

	---

	Modified the execute() builtin slightly so error reporting now
	uses the String assigned to argv[0], if it's not NULL, when the
	source is a String or StringStream. This primarily was to fix
	a long-standing complaint about tracking down some YWAIT errors.
	We also added an optional name argument to the eval() builtin
	that is used for the same purpose. See the reference pages for
	more detail.

	---

	Added code to YoixBodyComponent.mouseWheelMoved() that stops all
	MouseWheelEvents when a component has been disabled. Apparently
	AWT components behave properly but Swing components don't. We
	also added code to make sure scrollbars used by a JScrollPane
	are disabled when the JScrollPane is disabled.

	---

	Made lots of additions and several changes to the URL type. We
	renamed two fields
	
		headerfield --> responseheader
		requestproperty --> requestheader

	which probably weren't used in any real applications. We also
	added fields named connecttimeout, readtimeout, requestmethod,
	requestmethod, responsecode, responseerror and responsekeycase
	and guarantee that the response information is available after
	the URL is closed. See the reference page for more details.

	NOTE - two proxy related fields were added, but the quick tests
	that we ran didn't seem work properly. We will investigate and
	update the reference page when we're sure they work properly.

	---

	Modified the open() and fopen() builtins so they accept one or
	more key/value pairs that can be used to initialize fields in
	the returned stream that aren't explicitly set by the builtins.
	In addition open() now accepts a stream as the first optional
	argument and uses it for the actual open, which can be a way
	to recover error additional information that might otherwise
	be lost. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Modified strjoin() and strsplit() to accept NULL arguments and
	changed strjoin() so undefined elements in the array are skipped.
	We also made the second strjoin() argument optional.

	---

	Changed the default scroll setting for JTabbedPane to AS_NEEDED
	from NEVER. Improves layout manager behavior because AS_NEEDED
	means vertical space for each separate tab doesn't have to be
	reserved because the tabs don't wrap by default.

	---

	Added a columns field to JList that can be a useful way to set
	the width of an empty JList. See the reference page for more
	details.

	---

	Added a field named insets to JButton that can be used to adjust
	the default padding that's added to JButtons. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added infill(), ineofill() and instroke() builtins to Path that
	pretty much duplicate the corresponding Graphics builtins, but
	they provide a standalone hit-test capability for Paths which
	can occasionally be convenient.

	---

	Added builtins named round() and iround() to yoix.math. See the
	reference pages for more details.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the implementation of the charpath() builtin
	that led to an inconsistency in text drawn using the show() and
	charpath() builtins.

	---

	Added a field named queuesize field to the Thread type. See the
	reference page for more details.

	===

	Fixed a mistake in the mapping of the "ScrollPolicy" constants
	in YoixBodyComponent.java that accidentally mapped some uses
	of VERTICAL_AS_NEEDED and VERTICAL_NEVER to VERTICAL_ALWAYS.

	---

	Added code to YoixBodyComponentSwing.buttonGroupRemove() that
	allows writing an updated items array. Prior to the change you
	would get an invalidaccess error when you modified a non-null
	items array.

	---

	We removed synchronization from ydat/SwingJDataTable.drawBar()
	because it caused a few deadlocks. We now take a snapshot of
	the datatable array in that method and use the snapshot, which
	should prevent deadlock and null problems.

	---

	Made all variations of eval(), execute() and include() methods
	in Yoix.java public, so Java code that belongs to someone else
	can now easily run the Yoix interpreter.

	---

	Added YoixMiscJFC.getGray() that returns the NTSC gray value
	that for rgb values. Also added pickForeground() that uses
	getGray() to pick a foreground color that's appropriate for
	a particular background. No Yoix script access yet, but it
	might be worth adding a builtin.

	---

	Changed YoixMisc.copyIntoXXX() methods so they no longer expect
	Vectors or Hashtables. Probably should take another look before
	the next release.

	=== TODO List ===

	Tooltips don't work on YDAT background nodes and edges. It's a
	little more complicated then you might expect, and there hasn't
	been any real demand yet, but we eventually will get to it.

	---

	Seems like fields in URL (and maybe elsewhere) that are supposed
	to be supplied as unixtime doubles might also accept date strings
	that are parsed into unixtimes.

	---

	The BETA_PREFIX stuff in YWAIT may not be completely correct. We
	will investigate and fix it in a future release.

	---

	The regex support for the =~ and !~ operators probably could be
	more efficient.

	---

	Not convinced URL proxy related fields are all working properly.
	Also don't forget about new ifmodifiedsince behavior - think we
	may want to be more disciplined about time strings?? Behavior is
	not currently documented and can safely be changed.

    Version 2.1.6 (4/21/07 - external release)
	The handling of the parent field for AWT and Swing components
	meant there was a small chance that a parent window could be
	disposed without it also disposing of all its children. This
	was a rare occurrence, but when it happened it would lead to
	a memory leak. Our Java code has been fixed, which means the
	potential memory leak has also been plugged.

	---

	We made several changes in YoixBodyDictionaryObject.java that
	were needed to fix thread related problems that only surfaced
	in a production YWAIT application with lots of clients that all
	worked hard for an entire 8 hour shift. Even then we only saw
	about 10 to 15 unique occurrences per day.

	While tracking this problem down we made a few changes, like
	using a Hashtable instead of a HashMap for the nullcache in
	YoixObject.java, that we eventually may undo when we get the
	time and opportunity to test on the same production system.

	---

	We fixed a few small but annoying mistakes in YoixFontType0.java
	that could result in pointsize mismatches between fonts used by
	Swing and AWT components and the fonts used to draw and measure
	text using the builtins defined in Graphics.

	---

	By default this version no longer has VM.fixfonts set to TRUE,
	which means the low level font scaling adjustments that were
	calculated during startup on some platforms are now skipped on
	all platforms unless the +f command line option is used or

	    yoix.fixfonts = TRUE

	is defined in a property file.

	---

	We added fields named rowheightadjustment, useedithighlight,
	and visiblewidth to JTable. We also now recognize fields named
	inputLocale and locale in the attributes dictionary that can be
	used by the SET_COLUMN_FIELD action to control the formatting
	for individual columns. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	We added a field named selectedlabel to the JComboBox, JChoice,
	and JList components, but we currently haven't done it for the
	corresponding AWT components. See the reference pages for more
	details.

	---

	Added read-only fields named style and size to Fonts, so you
	no longer have to extract them from the Font's name field. We
	also added builtins named stringwidth() and stringbounds() to
	Fonts that behave exactly like the two builtins available in
	Graphics. We also added a builtin named stringBounds() to the
	yoix.graphics module, mostly because the stringWidth() builtin
	in that module is often the way scripts measure text. See the
	Font and stringBounds() reference pages for more details.

	---

	The access attribute now works even if the object that it's
	applied to is unreadable. The old implementation failed with
	an invalidaccess error, which really wasn't helpful if your
	program was just trying to see if the object was readable!!
	For the record, the access and name attributes are currently
	the only ones that can be applied to unreadable objects.

	---

	Added an attribute named growable that Yoix scripts can use to
	see if an object, like a dictionary or array, can be grown by
	at least one element. A non-zero answer, as you would get in

	    Array a[0, ...] = {"now", "is"};

	    if (a@growable)
		a[2] = "the";

	means the object can accommodate at least one more object.

	---

	Added an optional second argument to the linesplit() builtin
	that can be used when you're interested in recording blank
	lines. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named isShutdownHook() to yoix.system that can
	be used to see if the current thread is running shutdown hooks
	that were added by addShutdownHook(). See the reference page
	for more details.

	---

	The versions of YWAIT and YDAT available in this release have
	been improved, but there's currently no summary of the changes.

	===

	An interesting description of a problem that we also observed
	in a production system that was built using YWAIT. Most of the
	users were running Java 1.6.0, but some were using Java 1.5.0
	and a few of them had particularly big memory leaks and the
	explanation of those leaks can be found in

	    http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2006/04/leaking_evil.html

	and

	    http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6209673

	The hacks that are described as possible workarounds don't sound
	all that appealing so we probably won't implement them. Instead
	our solution, for now anyway, is to recommend that you use Java
	1.6.X to run the Yoix interpreter, particularly for a production
	application.

    Version 2.1.5 (2/28/07 - external release)
	We did quite a bit of work on YWAIT and YDAT in this release
	and we also now include several YDAT examples that are hooked
	directly up to the YWAIT demo that you can build and install
	on your own server.

	---

	TimeZone has been changed and no longer supports the fields
	that provided a way to directly manipulate daylight savings
	information.

	---

	Added optional radix and fail arguments to the atoi() and
	strton() builtins. See the reference pages for more info.

	---

	Added a optional second argument to UIManager.get(), that's
	used as the return value when a key string isn't found. See
	the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added code to YoixSwingJScrollPane.java that tries to improve
	mouse wheel scrolling behavior. Linux and Windows seemed to
	be the worst because on the systems we tested scrollAmount in
	the MouseWheelMoved event was always set to a constant value
	that was bigger than 1 (e.g., 3). Mac OSX never exhibited the
	behavior that we were trying to correct, so our mouse wheel
	scrolling aren't currently applied on that platform.

	---

	We addressed an annoying problem that showed up in Java 1.6
	when you drag columns around in a table that can also scroll
	horizontally, which seems to be caused by a mistake in Java's
	BasicTableHeaderUI class.

	---

	Fixed a JTable mistake that sometimes caused problems when a
	table was loaded after the columns had been moved.

	---

	Added code to YoixObject.getTransferData() that can handle a
	function or pointer to a function as the transferable. This
	was done so the object that's actually dropped can be picked
	right before the drop. It's now used by ydat drag and drop
	support code. Documentation has not been updated.

	===

	We added a setCursor() method to YoixBodyComponentSwing.java
	in 2.1.4 that also changed the peerscroller's cursor. We've
	removed the special version of setCursor(), but at the same
	time we added YoixSwingJScrollPane.setCursor() that doesn't
	change scrollbar cursors (from their default values). Also
	made a change to YoixSwingJTable.setCursor() that now sets
	the cursor in its peerscroller.

	---

	Added a mechanism that can be used to tell the interpreter
	to save a limited number of the exceptions that are caught
	internally but ignored. The debug flag DEBUG_EXCEPTIONS is
	used to enable the mechanism. When the DEBUG_JAVATRACE or
	DEBUG_STACKTRACE flags are used the requested dumps will
	also be printed on stderr. We added getSavedExceptions(),
	getSavedExceptionCount(), and setSavedExceptionLimit() to
	yoix.system but they haven't been documented yet. Also
	think setSavedExceptionLimit() should return the previous
	limit. These builtins aren't currently documented, mostly
	because our implementation may change.

    Version 2.1.4 (1/25/07 - external release)
	The most important changes this time were low level Java code
	fixes needed before Yoix and Java 1.6.0 would be completely
	compatible. At this point all the outstanding problems that we
	noticed using Java 1.6.0 have been fixed, so this is the first
	Yoix release that should work smoothly with Java 1.6.0.

	---

	YoixModuleImage.java no longer uses com.sun.image.codec.jpeg,
	which triggered compilation warnings under 1.6.0 that weren't
	suppressed by the -nowarn option.

	---

	Addressed a low level bug in Java 1.6.0 that seems to omit the
	step that closed subpaths before a fill. Meant code changes in
	in YoixBodyPath.java and ydat/SwingJGraphPlot.java.

	---

	Changed how a string argument is handled by the decodeImage()
	builtin. The old version assumed a string was a file name or
	URL that referenced the image to decode, but we now assume a
	string is a binary representation of an Image, which is what
	encodeImage() and encodeJPEG() return. Change was mostly for
	consistency and means the output of encodeImage() can be used
	as the argument that's handed to decodeImage(), but the fact
	that decodeImage() takes a stream argument means it still can
	be pointed at an image in a file or URL.

	---

	Deleted some undocumented and unimplemented builtins, namely
	decodeGIF, encodeGIF, decodePostScript, and encodePostScript,
	that were placeholders for builtins that we never implemented
	and so they always aborted with an "unimplemented" error.

	---

	Fixed some stream, socket and popupmenu bugs that had slipped
	into our code over the last few releases. We apologize for the
	mistakes.

    Version 2.1.3 (1/18/07 - external release)
	Included a config file named config_clf.yx that can be used
	to display httpd log files in the "common" or "combined" log
	format. It's not designed for big log files, and we haven't
	actually tested it enough to be able to tell you what the
	limits are, but we would expect reasonable performance on
	log files up to about 100,000 lines.

	If your httpd log is small enough and in the right format
	then something like

	    ydat -cclf access_log

	should pop up some interactive plots and histograms that
	are populated data that's extracted from your log file.

	We also hooked up mouse wheel zooming up to plots that are
	controlled by an axis. By default scrolling is horizontal
	in a plot, but you can hold the SHIFT key to get vertical
	scrolling.

	Incidentally, hitting the F2 function key in many components
	enables or disables drag and drop out of that component (we
	use the hand cursor to tell you when you can drag data out
	of a component).

	---

	Added robot support via the new yoix.robot module and also
	added a checkCreateRobot() security manager function that
	can also be triggered using "robot" and the -S command line
	option. See the reference pages for more detail.

	---

	The Yoix User-Agent string now uses '/' rather than space to
	separate the product and version identifiers. Was an oversight
	that we only recently noticed.

	---

	Added code to strsplit() that lets a dictionary or an array
	of dictionaries control the splitting. Was added quickly for
	an application that used Yoix - it may not be documented yet
	and if not it's still subject to change. We will revisit this
	in the near future.

	---

	An old one-line fix in YoixMiscTime.java was omitted in the
	current version but it has now be restored. The following

	    import yoix.util.*;
	    double t = 3607.0;
	    stdout.nextline = timerFormat("D'd 'Hh':'ZM':'ZS", t);

	works properly if the fix is in.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in YoixMiscMenu.java that sometimes caused
	the last description of a menu to be ignored. Change was in
	the buildAWTMenu() and buildSwingMenu() methods.

	---

	Changed YoixTipManager.java so a "dropped tip" always shows
	up, even when the tip wasn't visible at the time of the drop.

	---

	Made a small change in YoixSwingJComboBox.setSelectedItem()
	that seems to fix an occasional problem that showed up when
	an editable JComboBox was told (via its Yoix initializer)
	that first item was the selected. Looks like a Java issue,
	but we didn't try hard to track it down.

	===

	Removed an old static Frame in YoixImageObserver.java that
	was no longer used but could cause loading problems when the
	interpreter was running "headless".

	---

	Small style changes in YoixDragManager so labels that you get
	from YoixDragManager and YoixToolTipManager match.

	---

	Modified the getLayoutSize() methods in

	    YoixAWTCanvas.java
	    YoixAWTDialog.java
	    YoixAWTFrame.java
	    YoixAWTPanel.java
	    YoixAWTTextField.java
	    YoixAWTWindow.java
	    YoixSwingJDialog.java
	    YoixSwingJFrame.java
	    YoixSwingJPanel.java
	    YoixSwingJWindow.java

	so Dimensions with zero width or height fields only received
	special treatment when we get the preferred size. The change
	means minimumsize or maximumsize Dimensions can explicitly
	set their width or height to zero. Negative numbers still get
	special treatment in all cases.

	NOTE - the minimumsize and maximumsize fields aren't currently
	documented in any AWT or Swing component, so any of this can
	still be changed.

	NOTE - Java 1.5 added methods to set preferred, minimum, and
	maximum sizes to the AWT. Prior to 1.5 only Swing components
	could explicitly set the various sizes. In other words the
	only way for an AWT component could control its preferred,
	minimum, or maximum sizes was to override the Java methods
	that returned the values. When we no longer support 1.4.X we
	can also change how our AWT support for preferred, minimum,
	and maximum sizes.

	---

	Modified YoixSwingJScrollPane.getMinimumSize() so it always
	returns a zero sized Dimension. Previous implementation was
	more complicated and would sometimes return the container's
	preferred or minimum size.

	---

	Added a pickLayoutSize() method to YoixBodyComponent.java and
	now use it when Swing components set their preferred, minimum,
	and maximum sizes to a non-null value.

	NOTE - this probably should eliminate the need for similar
	code in files like YoixSwingJFrame.java that gets called when
	one these Swing components get their preferred, minimum, and
	maximum sizes. The ability for AWT components to set these
	values didn't appear until Java 1.5, so the old way is still
	needed in AWT versions of the classes, however we suspect we
	probably can remove the code from the Swing classes now that
	it's used in YoixBodyComponentSwing.java - later.

	---

	Added a Robot in YoixBodyComponent.java as part of a kludge
	to deal with relatively obscure cursor problems after a drop
	that happens on some versions of Linux but not on Windows or
	Mac OSX. The behavior on Linux is fixed in 1.6.0.

	---

	Added compareJavaTo() builtin to yoix.util, but we omitted
	documentation because the builtin may be removed in a future
	release. Don't count on it until you see a reference page.

    Version 2.1.2 (12/18/06 - external release)
	Made some changes to ydat/SwingJGraphPlot.java that affect
	the mouse wheel zoom behavior. By default zooming with the
	mouse wheel now uses the pointer's location in the graph as
	the point that's locked during the zoom. Holding CTRL while
	zooming with the mouse wheel restores the previous behavior,
	which always zoomed to the center and is still the way the
	zoom slider works.

	Using CTRL actually is somewhat convenient because holding
	CTRL and pressing the left mouse button in some histograms
	(e.g., the node or edge histograms in an xdot display) can
	center and flash the graph element that you selected. Move
	the pointer anywhere in the graph while still holding CTRL
	and the mouse wheel zooms to the selected element because
	it's now in the center of the graph display.

	---

	Added RAWSHELL_PATTERN as a flag that can be assigned to the
	type field of a Yoix Regexp. The only difference between the
	RAWSHELL_PATTERN and SHELL_PATTERN is that RAWSHELL_PATTERN
	doesn't assign any special meaning to backslash. We now use
	RAWSHELL_PATTERN to match patterns that can be specified by
	the -S command line option, which is particularly convenient
	if you're trying to match a Window file name using pattern.

	---

	Fixed a few bugs in ydat/SwingJGraphPlot.java that were all
	related to "plaintext" nodes. The mistakes were annoying but
	relatively obscure and for the most part only happened when
	you tried to move a plaintext node or any node connected to
	a plaintext node.

	---

	Made some changes in YoixStack.java that should eliminate
	fatal stackunderflow errors that occasionally happened when
	a Java method called VM.abort(). Eventually should use the
	UncaughtExceptionHandler interface defined in Java 1.5 to
	clean up the error output (i.e., Java stack trace and any
	other unwanted noise), but we still support Java 1.4.X for
	building and running the interpreter, so we'll wait a while.

    Version 2.1.1 (12/12/06 - external release)
	We're now distributing YDAT (Yoix Data Analysis Tool), which
	is a collection of scripts and Java class files that can be
	used to display and analyze data. Class files needed to run
	YDAT applications are now included in the yoix.jar file that
	can be downloaded from our web site or installed using the
	Yoix installer. When you run the demos remember that they're
	interactive, so try things, like holding a mouse button down
	as you move the pointer around in a histogram or graph (the
	the behavior of mouse buttons in a graph is controlled by the
	JChoice that appears in the lower right corner). If you see
	a horizontal or vertical axis press button 1 when the pointer
	is in the narrow light-gray region (the axis slider) and move
	the pointer. Press button 2 in that region you can drag the
	entire slider while you're hold the button down.

	When you run the installer you get a generic script named ydat,
	several other scripts that run canned YDAT demos, and another
	one named ydot that can be used with AT&T's graphviz software
	to display and manipulate graphs that have been formatted in
	the xdot output language (i.e., you used the -Txdot option
	when you ran a graphviz program like neato).

	YDAT uses config files to describe the data that its supposed
	to display, and right now the config file for graphviz xdot
	output is the only generally useful one that comes with this
	release. The situation should improve in the near future and
	we hope to provide more YDAT documentation and info about the
	config files that should let you customize YDAT and display
	your own data. In practice it's not all that difficult and a
	custom config file can often be built and tested in several
	hours, however without any documentation it would be a rather
	difficult task.

	One final note - the YDAT related Yoix scripts end up in the
	directory named ydat/scripts after you run the installer and
	the scripts that run YDAT point at ydat/scripts/ydat.yx. The
	entire ydat/scripts directory can be moved to a web server if
	you want and the definition of HOME in ydat.yx is the only
	thing you have to change when the files are moves to the web
	server. Point the various ydat scripts in the bin directory at
	the ydat.yx script on the server and YDAT will no longer be
	using the locally installed Yoix scripts.

	---

	Fixed a minor mistake in our low level Java code that sometimes
	failed to propagate settings, like the background or foreground,
	to the components in a container. The mistake was introduced in
	our last release and was hard to trigger, so we doubt anyone
	noticed yet, but we recommend that you upgrade to this release
	if you're currently running 2.1.0.

	---

	Added a special category named cwd to YoixSecurityOptions.java
	that can be used when you want to apply security settings to
	the files and subdirectories under where the user was when the
	Yoix interpreter was started.

	===

	Made a small change in the way Yoix.execute() handles security
	errors when they happen in a try/catch.

	---

	Changed convertRowIndexToModel() and convertRowIndexToView()
	from protected to public so everything compiles under 1.6. The
	Problem happened because the methods didn't exist in 1.5, but
	Sun added JTable sorting in 1.6.

    Version 2.1.0 (12/7/06 - external release)
	The new --applet command line option tells the interpreter to
	run scripts as applets rather than applications, which implies
	(but does not guarantee) stricter security checking. Once the
	interpreter is booted this option installs a security manager
	(see file YoixSecurityManager.java) that tries to enforce the
	security policy described by the Java policy files that are
	installed on your system, optionally modified by -S command
	line options that precede the --applet option. For example,

	    yoix -Sallow:readproperty -Sprompt:read --applet example.yx

	allows reading of individual system properties, prompts with a
	dialog before a local file is read, but it otherwise tries to
	enforce the security policy described by the Java policy files
	that are installed on your system. Detailed information about
	all options, including -S and --applet, is written to standard
	output when the interpreter encounters the --info command line
	option.

	The security related features that we added this release meant
	a major overhaul of two Java files that the interpreter uses to
	implement security features, namely YoixSecurityManager.java and
	YoixSecurityOptions.java. Questions about our implementation can
	probably be answered by taking a careful look at these two files,
	which come with the Yoix source code package. Remember, you don't
	get guarantees with open source software, but you do get to look
	"under the hood" if you want and decide for yourself.

	One other point that we should mention is that the interpreter
	currently can't finish its required initialization if you use a
	command line option to ask Java to install a security manager.
	Even something that looks like it should work, namely

	    java -Djava.security.manager=att.research.yoix.YoixSecurityManager

	won't because there aren't any hooks in YoixSecurityManager.java
	that skip checks if the interpreter appears to be booting. Since
	the interpreter runs without a security manager for a while, if
	you've decided to look at our Java code you probably also should
	follow it from startup in YoixMain.java to the security manager
	installation, which for an applet happens when YoixVM.prepareVM()
	triggers a YoixSecurityManager.setSecurityManager() call.

	---

	We added two Perl-like operators, namely =~ and !~, that compare
	a String, int, or double to a regular expression that can be
	represented as a String or Regexp. For example,

	    import yoix.*.*;

	    while ((str = readLine(stdin)) != NULL) {
		if (str =~ "[^0-9]")
		    fprintf(stderr, "input |%s| isn't all digits\n", str);
	    }

	reads lines from stdin and writes a message to stderr when any
	line contains a character that isn't a digit. The =~ and !~
	operators are documented in the "operators" reference page that
	can be found in the grammar section.

	---

	We added two new string quoting mechanisms, namely @<...>@ and
	@<<...>>@, that resemble a quoting mechanism that's available
	in Daytona. We also added a reference page named "quotes" to the
	grammar section that describes the quoting mechanisms available
	to Yoix scripts.

	---

	Our GridBagLayout implementation now supports a flexible style
	that can sometimes lead to compact descriptions of a container's
	layout. This is often true for JPanels that display a series of
	labeled JTextFields or a row of JChoices separated by strings.
	See the documentation for more details. Unfortunately we haven't
	time to convert our existing examples or convert most of YWAIT
	screens, but there is at least one substantial application that
	we know of that is now extensively using the new style.

	Supporting the new the style meant disabling the GridBagLayout's
	support for the fronttoback field. We seriously doubt anyone is
	using fronttoback, which was mostly a kludge for printing that
	we added to our early releases. We probably will disable support
	for it in all layout manager in the near future and the field
	itself may also disappear unless we get complaints from users.

	---

	Every layout manager now accepts a string where a component is
	supposed to be and they use that string as the text displayed
	by a label. Properties, like the font or foreground color, used
	by these short-hand labels can't be directly specified, so they
	are inherited from the enclosing container.

	---

	Added iconified, maximized, and autodeiconify fields to JFrame
	and Frame. The default setting of autodeiconify is TRUE, which
	means iconified frames are now automatically deiconified when
	TRUE is stored in their visible field. See the reference pages
	for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named queueOnce() to Thread that can be called
	when you want to make sure an action, as described by a function
	and its arguments, is only queued once. queueOnce() compares its
	arguments to actions that are queued or running and only queues
	the arguments if they're not found. Most of the YWAIT screens
	now use this builtin (via the QueueCommandOnce() function) when
	the user does something, like press a button, that contacts the
	server.

	---

	Added the root itself to the components dictionary so that the
	root component can be referenced by its tag in the components
	dictionary the same as other components. This was needed when
	we implemented the YWAIT NewJTabbedPane2Screen() "constructor"
	that lets users drag one or more of the JPanels managed by a
	JTabbedPane into their own JFrames. It's a unique new feature
	that we added to YWAIT in this release, but right now you may
	have to build your own example using NewJTabbedPane2Screen()
	to see how interesting it really is. We will try to build an
	example YWAIT screen in a future release, but we probably won't
	get time to do it until early next year (2007).

	---

	Made some Java code changes that improve the behavior of our
	JTabbedPane. We also decided to change the default UIManager
	setting for the "TabbedPane.contentOpaque" property from true
	(Java's choice) to false, which we think is more appropriate.
	Yoix applications can add

	    VM.screen.uimanager.put("TabbedPane.contentOpaque", TRUE);

	if they want to restore Java's default.

	---

	Changed behavior of JChoice and JComboBox slightly to match
	the behavior of AWT components (e.g., Choice and List) when
	a "label" string (i.e., one of the displayed text strings) is
	stored in the selected field. The old implementation for the
	Swing components didn't recognize "label" strings, but we now
	also look through the displayed text strings before deciding
	that a string can or can't be displayed by the component.

	---

	Added lots of new attributes to JTableColumn: zeroNotShown,
	overflow, underflow, inputFormat, lowSubstitute, highSubstitute,
	timeZone, inputTimeZone. See the SET_COLUMN_FIELD description
	under the action() builtin in the JTable reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named findNextMatch() and fields named extent,
	origin, viewport, and viewrowcount to JTable. See the reference
	page for more details.

	---

	Added JList, JScrollPane, JTable, JTextArea, JTextPane, and
	ScrollPane to the collection of AWT and Swing components that
	support the adjustmentValueChanged() event handler. Also added
	an orientation field to AdjustmentEvent so an event handler in
	these components can figure out which scrollbar triggered the
	AdjustmentEvent that they received.

	---

	New csvsplit(), htob(), and linesplit() builtins were added to
	yoix.string. See the documentation for more details.

	---

	Added a distance() builtin to yoix.awt and yoix.swing. See the
	reference page for more details.

	---

	Changed the toFront() and toBack() builtins so they no longer
	complain if they're handed a NULL argument.

	---

	Calendar and TimeZone were updated in this release, so take a
	look at the reference pages if you're using either one.

	---

	We finally documented the getArrayBands() builtin, which first
	appeared in yoix.util in release 1.3.0, but for some reason a
	reference page was never written.

	---

	Added code to YoixBodyComponent.handleDnDEvent() that stops all
	drag and drop events when a component has been disabled.

	---

	Removed the field named specials from JTable in favor of the
	column specific lowSubstitute and highSubstitute attributes
	that are now supported by JTableColumn.

	---

	Removed the getSecurityManager() builtin and changed the value
	returned by setSecurityManager() and setSecurityChecker() so
	1 indicates success and 0 indicates failure. Applications that
	need to install their own security manager or security checker
	must use the value returned by these builtins to verify that
	the operation succeeded. If the interpreter is running as an
	applet (i.e., the --applet command line option was supplied)
	then these builtins will always return 0 to indicate failure.

	===

	Fixed a mistake in 'for (ptr in dict)' loops that resulted in an
	infinite loop when continue was used inside the loop.

	---

	Fixed a thread issue in our low level setup for https that meant
	the setup might not finish before the interpreter tried to open
	a script that needed the https support. This was most likely to
	happen when the command line script needed https support, but it
	wasn't restricted to that case and the incorrect behavior wasn't
	always reproducible.

	---

	Removed a typecheck error when a dialog or window's parent was
	disposed before the screen was built. Seems reasonable and was
	done to eliminate an error message in YWAIT applications if a
	dialog's parent was disposed before the dialog was even built.
	It's something that might happen when a database query takes a
	long time and the user gets impatient.

	---

	We added YoixSwingJScrollPane class to compensate for annoying
	layout behavior that occurred when layout managers asked a
	JScrollPane for its minimum size. Unfortunately JViewport.java
	(actually ViewportLayout.java) returns a 4x4 pixel square as
	its minimum size, which really didn't seem like the best answer
	for most situations.

	---

	Fixed a typo in YoixBodyStream.cancelOutputInit() that mistakenly
	used inputinit instead of outputinit in the initial test.

	---

	Fixed a spelling typo in the string associated with N_ICONIFIED.
	The old version spelled it "iconfied" even though the constant
	was spelled properly. The mistake only affected JInternalFrame,
	which isn't used much, so we doubt the change will affect anyone.

	---

	Added several public variations of call() to YoixMisc.java. They
	are particularly helpful when writing custom modules. We should
	take a look at all similar call() methods that are currently
	defined and probably should use the ones in YoixMisc whenever
	possible,

	=== TODO List ===

	Thread.queue() should accept a pointer to a function. Should also
	make sure other similar cases (if any) behave the same way. This
	has been on our list of things to do for a while now - sorry.

	---

	Consider adding support for Java's SpringLayout.

	---

	Consider adding support for InputMap to all Swing components.
	Definitely not urgent.

	---

	JComboBox recognizes focusaction but it's not documented. Don't
	know if the omission was intentional?

	---

	Disable fronttoback, delete the field from all containers, and
	remove it from all reference pages unless users complain.

	---

	Decide what should happen to the JTable OBJECT_TYPE support that
	was added quickly for a YWAIT application but is no longer used.
	Also ended up adding pickSortObject() and pickTableObject() to
	JTableColumn as part of the support. This is undocumented stuff
	that probably will be changed or removed in the near future, so
	don't use it!!

    Version 2.0.3 (8/16/06 - external release)
	Improved how Canvas and JCanvas handling itemStateChanged() when
	sticky is set to TRUE, which makes simulating a checkbox easier.
	Definitely not a big deal - in fact we suspect we're the only
	ones that use this feature and we only occasionally need it in
	customs screens that are built for YWAIT.

	---

	Fixed a careless mistake in YoixBodyBlock.restoreLvalues() that
	could accidentally raise the access permissions associated with
	a thread. This fix, on its own, is a good reason to upgrade to
	this release.

	---

	We added an accelerator field to JMenuItem and changed the Java
	code that builds menus from Menu arrays to accept a dictionary
	as the second argument, which means accelerators can be defined
	when menus are described by a Menu. See the JMenuItem and Menu
	reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added fields named insets and bounds to the VM.screen dictionary
	that can help account for the decorations that a window manager
	adds to the screen. The VM.screen.bounds Rectangle incorporates
	VM.screen.insets, so it's probably the only one you need to use.

	Unfortunately Java doesn't seem to get a good answer from some
	window managers (e.g., Gnome on Linux), so these values aren't
	as helpful as you might expect. Our current implementation also
	just takes a snapshot of the values when the interpreter starts,
	so changes to the configuration of your window manager while the
	interpreter is running won't be reflected in VM.screen.insets or
	VM.screen.bounds. We eventually will change our implementation,
	but we don't consider it urgent because we don't always get good
	numbers back from Java.

	---

	Added code to our Java implementation of printf() to handle NaN
	and Infinity properly. Our old implementation printed nonsense
	numbers for those special cases.

	---

	The htoa() and urlDecode() now return "" when they're handed a
	zero length string. The old versions returned NULL, which meant
	that

		atoh(htoa(""))

	or

		urlEncode(urlDecode(""));

	would fail because atoh() and urlEncode() complained when they
	were handed a NULL argument. The change means atoh() and htoa()
	are inverses, as are urlEncode() and urlDecode().

	---

	The BETA_PREFIX variable that's defined in the YWAIT makefiles
	now works properly. It can be used to build and install a test
	version of the server code that runs in the same directories as
	a production version.

	===

	Improved strsplit() and JTree loading speed for large sets of
	data by replacing the growable array or dictionary used by our
	internal implementation with a large ArrayList or HashMap that
	is only copied into the Yoix array or dictionary at the very
	end. Performance issues can be noticeable because by default
	Yoix arrays and dictionaries grow one slot at a time (unless
	asked to do otherwise), which can result in a big performance
	hit if it has to be done often.

	---

	The initialization of selected for JMenuItem in YoixModuleSwing
	now matches JButton (i.e., it's NULL) so Yoix initializers can
	set either state or selected fields and the interpreter will be
	able to tell which one was set. The state field wins if both
	fields are set in the initializer.

	---

	Added public strfmt() methods to YoixMiscPrintf.java as a way
	for Java code to easily access printf() capabilities.

	---

	Added a reflection call to YoixAWTInvocationEvent.run() that
	provides an easy way to handle invokeLater(). Sometimes helps
	when you're writing a custom module.

	---

	Added YoixTipManager class that currently is used by a custom
	module, however we plan on providing Yoix script level access
	to the capabilities in the near future.

	=== TODO List ===

	Look for other instances of internal code that use growable
	arrays or dictionaries and change the implementation if they
	could be forced to do lots of growing. Performance issues can
	start appearing when the Yoix arrays or dictionaries have to
	get big but are forced grow one slot at a time.

	---

	Consider adding field named text to a JTree that can be used
	to build the tree from a relatively simple text representation.
	The idea is illustrated in the jtree2.yx example, but it's not
	exactly what we want. Needs careful thought before Java code is
	added to our JTree implementation!!

    Version 2.0.2 (4/25/06 - external release)
	We made several small changes to the YWAIT package that were
	needed to support an existing application that had been written
	using an old (and unreleased) version of YWAIT.

	---

	Fixed an obscure stream related bug that affected streams that
	were opened for reading and writing. The mistake was introduced
	in version 2.0.0.

	---

	We made a small change that improves the appearance of some
	JComboBoxes in the Aqua look-and-feel that's available on OSX.

    Version 2.0.1 (4/20/06 - external release)
	Fixed several mistakes in the YWAIT package that made builds
	on Solaris fail when Sun's versions of make or /bin/sh were
	used. We also changed the YWAIT cgi scripts, which are small
	shell scripts, so they no longer use features that require
	ksh or bash.

	---

	There only source code changes that we made in the interpreter
	were so insignificant that they don't even deserve a mention.

    Version 2.0.0 (3/29/06 - external release)
	The interpreter's command line option processing has changed
	in this release. Many obscure options are no longer supported
	or are now only available using long options. A summary of the
	available options can be obtained using -? or --help. Scripts
	that start the interpreter using options that were removed or
	moved will definitely need attention.

	The changes were introduced after long options were added to
	the Yoix getopt() builtin. The Option and getopt() reference
	pages describe the new features that are available to Yoix
	scripts.

	---

	We claimed "in" and "by" as new reserved words and we use them
	in a modified version of a for loop that eliminates some of the
	overhead involved in a standard for loop. The syntax is

		for (name in expression) {
		    ...
		}

	or

		for (name in expression by expression) {
		    ...
		}

	The first expression is required and must evaluate to a Pointer
	(e.g., an Array or Dictionary) that's the target of the for loop.
	The optional second expression must evaluate to a number that's
	used as the loop increment, which is 1 by default. Inside the
	loop name is a read-only pointer that can be dereferenced when
	you want access to the next element in the target object.

	For example, the standard for loop

		import yoix.*.*;

		Pointer ptr;

		for (ptr = VM; ptr@sizeof > 0; ptr += 3)
		    printf("%s=%O\n", *ptr@nameof, *ptr);

	that dumps every third element in the VM dictionary can also be
	written as

		import yoix.*.*;

		for (ptr in VM by 3)
		    printf("%s=%O\n", *ptr@nameof, *ptr);

	using the new for loop notation.

	---

	The overall performance of the interpreter has improved, but
	there's still quite a bit more that could be done. We plan on
	continuing the performance improvements, but they're really
	not a high priority because we believe the Yoix interpreter
	already performs remarkably well in applications, like YWAIT,
	that it was designed for. If you disagree let us know - we
	can easily shift our priorities if there's a real demand.

	---

	Low level interpreter code that tries to calculate a single
	platform dependent font scaling factor has now been enabled.
	This is a change from earlier releases so you there's a small
	chance you'll notice a difference, however in most cases we
	expect any noticeable changes will be an improvement. The -f
	or --fixfonts command line options let enable or disable this
	font scaling.

	Unfortunately, Java 1.4.X running on Linux sometimes seems to
	use different size fonts in AWT and Swing components. In other
	words, tell a Swing and AWT component to use exactly the same
	font and if you're using 1.4.X on Linux you may end up with
	different results in the two components. We haven't observed
	the behavior in 1.5.0.

	---

	Added keystore support to the Yoix interpreter, which means
	SSL certificates can be managed pretty much the way browsers
	do. Users are always prompted with information about a new
	certificate before it's stored the interpreter's keystore.

	We also added the --acceptcertificates option that tells the
	interpreter to silently accept certificates without storing
	them in the keystore. It's a special purpose option that's
	really only designed for a program, like a web crawler, that
	reads web pages and doesn't want to be prompted by every new
	certificate.

	---

	We made low level encoding changes that separate the encoding
	that the parser uses to read a script from the encoding that
	the interpreter uses when it reads streams. The names of the
	encodings used to read scripts and streams are stored in

		VM.encoding.parser

	and

		VM.encoding.stream

	as strings that can be read or written by Yoix scripts or set
	using the --parserencoding and --streamencoding command line
	options. Two other values in VM.encoding, namely

		VM.encoding.JVM

	and

		VM.encoding.VM

	are read-only strings that record the default encoding used by
	Java and the Yoix interpreter.

	We also added a builtin named getAvailableCharsets() to yoix.io
	that provides a complete list of the encodings that your system
	recognizes. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added fields named uimanager and headless to VM.screen. The
	uimanager field means scripts no longer have to create their
	own UIManager when they want to query or change the look and
	feel. The headless field will be non-zero whenever the Yoix
	interpreter is started in an environment that doesn't support
	a display, keyboard, or mouse.

	---

	Added a theme field to UIManager, so yoix scripts can select
	various themes that may be supported by a look and feel. The
	"Metal" look and feel available in Java 1.5 is the only one
	that currently supports themes and the only working themes
	that we found were "Ocean" and "Steel".

	---

	Made changes to UIMamanger so fonts for each LookAndFeel are
	scaled based on the command line magnification and platform
	dependent scaling. Done for consistency and to fix JOptionPane
	fonts, which on Linux were often way too small. Changes mean
	supported UIMananger look-and-feels should be thought of as
	being created when the interpreter boots, so fonts in those
	look-and-feels won't be affected when a Yoix script changes
	VM.fontmagnification.

	---

	Added autotrim, selectedends, and text fields to a JComboBox
	that duplicate the behavior of the fields in other component
	(e.g., JTextField). It also now supports a textValueChanged()
	event handler, which really only makes sense if the JComboBox
	is editable. The changes make it easier for a GUI application
	to switch between using a JTextField and a JComboBox. See the
	reference page for more details.

	---

	We added a field named persistent to the Process and Socket
	types. Setting persistent to TRUE tells the Yoix interpreter
	it shouldn't explicitly stop a Process or close a Socket when
	the interpreter exits. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a read-only field named focusowner to all AWT and Swing
	components that can be read to determine if component has the
	keyboard focus.

	---

	Added a field named reset to JColorChooser that can be used to
	reset the reference color that the JColorChooser displays. We
	also added support for the stateChanged() event handler. See
	the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a field named altgridcolor and action named MOVE_COLUMN
	to JTable. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named fmt() to yoix.string that can be used to
	break or consolidate text so each line fits within limits that
	can be specified in the call. This can be a convenient way to
	prepare text that is supposed to be displayed in a component,
	like a JTextArea. See the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named addShutdownHook() to yoix.system that
	arranges for Yoix functions to be called right before the
	Java virtual machine shuts down. See the reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added builtins named addListener() and removeListener() to
	yoix.awt and yoix.swing. The addListener() builtin lets you
	add new listener to an existing AWT or Swing component, which
	is something that was not allowed in previous releases. See
	the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named nanoTime() to yoix.system that can be
	used to measure time intervals in nanosecond precision. See
	the reference page for more details.

	---

	Added a builtin named getColorName() and updated the addColor()
	builtin, both of which are defined in yoix.awt and yoix.swing.
	See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added builtins named htmlEncode(), htmlDecode() to yoix.string.
	See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	New builtins named encodeImage() and decodeImage() were added
	to yoix.image. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added an optional int argument to stringbounds() that can be
	set to non-zero when you want the rectangle to be a tight fit
	to the text string. By default the fit is loose, with font
	properties, like ascent and descent, controlling the vertical
	span of the rectangle. 

	---

	The Tree type has been renamed ParseTree, so Yoix scripts that
	used Tree variables must be changed. We doubt this will affect
	any external applications.

	---

	Simple grammar change lets global and restricted blocks omit
	the lvalue (usually a dictionary). Changes were easy but may
	not be all that useful, except to run quick interactive tests.

	===

	Fixed the low level implementation of the charpath() builtin
	in YoixFontType0.java, which built a FontRenderContext that
	always disabled antialiasing and fractionalmetrics, even if
	they were enabled in by the appropriate Graphics object. The
	mistake meant that measurements, like pathbbox(), taken from
	a charpath() path wouldn't necessarily hold when the same
	text was rendered using show().

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the translatepath() builtin that omitted
	using the currentmatrix to transform its arguments to device
	space. Was really inconvenient (and wrong) because skipping
	the step meant the were always assumed to be in device space.

	---

	Fixed a gvsubsti bug that made it misbehave rather badly when
	no pattern was set in its Regexp argument.

	---

	A late change in YoixVM.java restricts the platform dependent
	font scaling factor to a number greater than or equal to 1.0.
	Only happens when N_FIXFONTS is 1, so we might provide a way
	to set it to something other than TRUE and FALSE?? Not 100%
	convinced by the changes.

	---

	Changed calculation of getPreferredScrollableViewportSize() in
	YoixSwingJTextArea.java so it matches getPreferredSize(). Swing
	currently (i.e., in 1.5.0) omits margins when determining the
	JTextArea's preferred size for a JScrollPane, so you normally
	end up with a vertical scroll bar in a JTextArea that has rows
	and insets set.

	---

	Made several low level changes to help with "skins". One was
	to apply opaque setting for a screen to it's menubar if the
	menubar hasn't explicitly set its opaque field to a non-NULL
	value. The other change was to YoixMiscJFC.paintBackground()
	and all we now do is check the component's opaque setting
	before painting.

	---

	Added a field named uimkey to Swing and AWT components. It's
	not documented yet because we're not convinced it's a useful
	addition, which means it may disappear in future releases and
	that means you shouldn't use it!!

	---

	Added an optional argument to cstring() builtin. Currently
	undocumented and not used, so there's a good chance it will
	be removed in a future release.

	=== TODO List ===

	Converting our FontMetrics code to LineMetrics should let us
	remove an undocumented option that may still be needed by an
	old (but important) application. Probably won't be difficult,
	but that old application will need lots of testing.

	---

	Eventually may want to synchronize some of the addListener()
	methods in YoixBodyComponent.java. The addListener() builtin
	can now test and set bits in event mask and the way it's done
	right now may not be completely thread safe. Definitely good
	enough for now, but we eventually should revisit this.

	---

	Not convinced there's an easy way to get a copy of a path.
	Reading Graphics.path doesn't return a snapshot - maybe it
	should?? Something to investigate.

	---

	Added setPrebootAcceptCertificates() and called in YoixMain.
	Done slightly differently the other prebootXXX, but it looks
	like there should be a better way. We eventually clean this
	up, probably by providing a method in YoixModule.java that
	can access values stored in $init[] tables - later.

	---

	Consider renaming EMPTY and all related stuff. Seems like
	VOID would be better. Also added isEmptyString() method
	to YoixObject.java. Think the length() test can be changed
	slightly (do we need to do stringValue()??). Also may want
	other methods (e.g., isEmptyArray(), isEmptyDictionary()).
	Just a thought - definitely not important.

    Version 1.4.0 (11/14/05 - external release)
	This release no longer runs under Java 1.3.1, which means
	we don't need reflection to support features that appeared
	in Java 1.4 (e.g., encryption, new event modifiers, better
	sockets). All the reflection used to provide runtime support
	for Java 1.3.1 has been removed from the source code.

	---

	You'll find extensive cryptographic support in this release
	using the new Certificate, Cipher, Key, and KeyStore types
	and the constants and builtins that are defined in the new
	yoix.secure module. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	DatagramSocket, ServerSocket and Socket have been improved
	and they all now provide complete support for features that
	were added in Java 1.4. Part of the cleanup work removed or
	renamed several fields that we supported in older versions,
	so applications that use any of the Yoix sockets will need
	some minor changes before they will run under this release.
	See the reference pages for more details, including a list
	of the fields that changed or disappeared.

	Please send us mail if you have a socket application that
	breaks in this release - we undoubtedly can help and don't
	mind hearing complaints about our incompatible changes.

	---

	MulticastSocket is new and can be used to send and receive
	multicast UDP packets. Our simple tests on Windows and OSX
	seemed to work, but we were not able to receive multicast
	UDP packets on any Linux system that we tried. We suspect
	the behavior is related to issues described in the 4701650
	Java bug report. See the reference page and the bug report
	for more details.

	---

	Random is a new type defined in yoix.math that can generate
	pseudo-random and "cryptographically strong" random numbers.
	It was added as part of our new cryptographic support, but
	can be used whenever an application needs random numbers.
	See the reference page for more details.

	---

	We added seven new builtins (e.g., getInterfaceAddresses(),
	isLinkLocalAddress()) to yoix.net. See the reference pages
	for more details.

	---

	DragGestureEvent, KeyEvent, MouseEvent, and MouseWheelEvent
	define a new field named modifiersdown that represents the
	state of all keyboard modifiers and mouse buttons when the
	event occurred. See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	File, URL, and StringStream have a field named interrupted
	that is incremented when a read operation is interrupted.
	See the reference pages for more details.

	---

	The low level code that tries to compensate for font size
	mistakes across platforms has been improved and is enabled
	by default. The -f command line option or "fixfonts" property
	file entry can be used to disable the font size adjustments
	and means you get exactly what Java would give you when you
	ask for a font. We also fixed a mistake that failed to apply
	the font size adjustments to the Java font that windows use
	when their font field is set to NULL.

	---

	We made "restricted" a keyword that is used to start a named
	block that behaves like a "global" named block but is subject
	to some restrictions. For example, include, import, try/catch,
	and global named blocks are not allowed, reserved values like
	execute(), stdin, stdout, stderr, and yoix will be NULL, and
	others, like typedict and argv, start with restricted values.
	A Yoix script that uses a restricted block can pass objects
	into the restricted block by storing them in the dictionary
	that's used for the block's storage, so the Yoix script has
	the final say over how "restricted" the block really is.

	---

	Added code that lets Yoix scripts catch SecurityExceptions
	using try/catch. This eventually may be expanded to include
	more (perhaps all) Java Throwables, but we didn't have time
	right now to implement and test everything.

	---

	We improved the Yoix installer and added controls that let
	you pick the default font magnification. The installer has
	always been included in the source code that we distribute
	and now you can build an installer using the makefile that
	we distribute with the installer source code.

	---

	Made several changes to our Java code that gets called to
	interpret the mouse buttonmodel that can be set using the
	-b command line option or the "buttonmodel" property file
	entry. The default buttonmodel is now 0, which makes no
	changes to event modifiers when a mouse button is pressed,
	clicked, dragged, or moved.

	The change should only affect users on a Mac who also happen
	to have a one-button mouse. The default buttonmodel setting
	in our previous release automatically translated a MouseEvent
	with button 1 and the control key pressed into a MouseEvent
	that looked like button 2 had been pressed. Unfortunately we
	can't tell what kind of mouse generated a MouseEvent, so the
	the translation requested by the default buttonmodel applied
	to every MouseEvent on a Mac, even when a multi-button mouse
	was being used. Mac users who what to the old behavior can
	get it with -b1 command line option or "buttonmodel" property
	file entry.

	---

	If you grab our source package you may notice some functional,
	but still incomplete and undocumented Java 3D work. We hope to
	return to the work, perhaps in a few months, but right now it's
	not high on our list of things to do. Any help, as usual, will
	be appreciated!!

    Version 1.3.2 (8/30/05 - external release)
	We added MouseWheelEvent to the collection of events supported
	by the Yoix interpreter. MouseWheelEvents automatically go to
	a mouseWheelMoved() event handler, if it's defined in an AWT
	or Swing component.

	NOTE - Java introduced MouseWheelEvents in 1.4, so you won't
	get them if you're still using Java 1.3.1.

	---

	Our implementation of the "this" keyword has finally improved
	and now handles functions that are defined in a block. Thanks
	to Xinyu Feng for input on this one!! See the reference page
	for a complete description of the "this" keyword.

	---

	Fixed a mistake that caused the urlEncode() builtin to throw
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when it tried to encode binary
	data.

	---

	Small changes to paintRect() method in YoixAWTTextComponent
	and YoixSwingJTextComponent.

	---

	Added int argument to YoixMisc.javaTrace() that controls the
	number of lines dumped.

    Version 1.3.1 (8/13/05 - external release)
	Fixed a parser mistake that meant it sometimes didn't backup
	over lookahead that was consumed to recognize a bare if-else
	statement. The mistake never affected if-else statements in
	blocks (e.g., function bodies), so it really didn't happen
	often.

	---

	We now compensate for subtle changes in TimeZone.getDefault()
	and TimeZone.setDefault() that were introduced in Java 1.5.0.
	We're not sure why Sun made the Thread-based TimeZone changes
	in 1.5.0, but Yoix scripts now will not notice them.

	---

	The setTimeZone() builtin was changed slightly and now takes
	a missing or NULL argument as a request to reset the timezone
	to the original system default.

	---

	Implementation of setOrigin() in YoixAWTTextComponent.java
	and YoixSwingJTextComponent.java has been improved slightly
	and now does a better job handling scrolling under a window
	that covers part of the component. Our solution doesn't catch
	everything, but it's not bad and doesn't affect performance
	much. Might not need the kludges if copyArea() was friendlier
	and returned something that told us that the copy didn't work.
	PaintEvents automatically generated by copyArea() don't seem
	to be a complete solution, particularly when you're scrolling
	rapidly.

	---

	Fixed a class cast mistake in YoixMake.java that sometimes
	affected the Yoix implementation of UIMananger.

	---

	Fixed a small mistake in YoixBodyString.cstringValue() that
	occasionally affected the cstring() builtin.

	---

	Added a kludge to YoixBodyComponentSwing.java that seems to
	eliminate deadlock problems that occasionally happened when
	a JFileDialog was created on a Mac.

    Version 1.3.0 (7/14/05 - external release)
	You can now add custom drag and drop handling to any Swing
	or AWT component using Yoix versions of Java's drag and drop
	event handlers (e.g., dragGestureRecognized(), dragEnter(),
	drop()) that are described in their reference pages. Swing
	components can use the new TransferHandler type or event
	handlers when they want custom drag and drop support, but
	the TransferHandler approach won't work with AWT components.

	Everything should be documented in the reference pages, but
	the information is spread out in a few different files. Take
	a look at DragGestureEvent, DragSourceEvent, DropTargetEvent,
	dragGestureRecognized(), dragEnter(), and drop() if you want
	to know more about the event handlers. Otherwise look at the
	TransferHandler reference page.

	---

	Added a field named dragenabled to all Swing components that
	can be set to TRUE when you want to enable Swing's automatic
	drag handling. Components that don't provide automatic drag
	handling always return FALSE when their dragenabled field is
	read, even immediately after you store TRUE in that field.

	---

	We added a Clipboard type and a getSystemClipboard() builtin
	in yoix.system that can be used for cut and paste operations.
	The details are described in the reference page.

	---

	Custom cursors are now available. They can be built using an
	Image and assigned to to the cursor field that's defined in
	all AWT and Swing components. The reference pages have all
	been updated and there's at least one non-trivial example in
	the Image reference page, which is a good place to start. Pay
	close attention to the hotspot, paint, size, and type fields
	that are defined in an Image - they're often the most useful
	when you're building a custom cursor.

	---

	A new builtin named addCursor() is defined in the yoix.swing
	and yoix.awt modules. It lets you add a custom cursor to the
	official Cursor that's defined in yoix.swing and yoix.awt. We
	also added the getBestCursorSize() and getMaximumCursorColors()
	builtins that can sometimes help when you're building a cursor.
	The getMaximumCursorColors() documentation may be missing or
	incomplete (it sometimes gave some confusing answers that we
	need to track down), but the other two builtins are documented
	and there's another custom cursor example in the addCursor()
	reference page.

	---

	Added a builtin named captureScreen() to yoix.image that can
	be used to copy all or part of the screen to an image. See the
	reference page for more details.

	---

	We changed our Swing border code so a border with a title is
	created whenever a string is assigned to a Swing component's
	border field.

	---

	We added a field named border to JFrame, JDialog, JFileDialog,
	and JWindow, which means you can easily add a border to any of
	them without having to modify the layout of their components.

	We added the border field to JInternalFrame, but weren't happy
	with the results, so it probably shouldn't be used because the
	behavior may change in a future release.

	---

	JTextArea, JTextField, or JTextPane components can now define
	a textValueChanged() event handler if they want to receive a
	TextEvent whenever the text stored in the component changes.
	We added fields, named length, offset, and type to TextEvent
	that further identify what happened when something changes in
	a JTextArea, JTextField, or JTextPane. AWT components, like a
	TextField, that define a textValueChanged() event handler get
	a TextEvent that includes the three new fields but they won't
	be initialized with any useful information.

	---

	Changed the implementation of Graphics.erasedrawable() so it
	erases a drawable component, like a Canvas or JFrame, using
	the background color and the backgroundimage that are defined
	in that drawable. Before the change erasedrawable() only used
	the component's background color. We also made improvements
	in the way erasedrawable() handles images, but we don't think
	anyone will notice.

	---

	The value assigned to the backgroundimage field that's defined
	in some AWT and Swing components can now be an Image, String, or
	NULL. A string that's not NULL should name a local a file or URL
	that contains a GIF or JPEG image.

	---

	Made some changes to addColor(), which now returns TRUE if the
	color was successfully added and FALSE if the operation failed.
	We also removed the optional hsb argument since there now is a
	builtin named getHSBColor() that makes colors based on the HSB
	model.

	---

	We documented all Yoix event handlers, including the ones that
	handle drag and drop, added listEventHandlers() to yoix.event,
	and moved the dictionary that maps Yoix event handler names to
	integers to yoix.event.HandlerID from yoix.awt.Event. See the
	reference pages for more details.

	---

	Added YoixPointerActive.initializer() method that sub-classes
	can call, usually at the very end of their constructors, when
	final initialization can be handled by a Yoix function named
	initializer() that's defined in their data dictionary. May not
	be used in standard Yoix classes yet, but there's at least one
	new custom module that's currently using it. Tiny chance we'll
	eventually implement finalizer(), but that could be asking for
	trouble!! 

	---

	Made lots of changes to YoixObject.java that were designed to
	make it usable as a superclass in custom modules. Most of the
	changes were access related and you will now find quite a few
	protected methods that are designed to be used by classes that
	extend YoixObject.java. We also added an empty interface named
	YoixAPIProtected that we used to mark classes that your custom
	modules can extend. We haven't finished with the changes, but
	did think they should be mentioned - we're planning many more
	in the next release or two.

	---

	We also removed final from the definitions of getManageObject()
	and body() in YoixObject. Done to let classes in other packages
	that extend YoixObject define them as super.getManagedObject()
	and super.body(), which will essentially give other classes in
	the same package access to the low level YoixObject methods.

	---

	We collected some of the Java reflection code that we had used
	in the interpreter and in several custom modules and put them
	in a new file named YoixReflect.java. You might find something
	useful there if you're writing you're own Yoix module, but it's
	otherwise not particularly noteworthy.

	---

	A mistake in our IO code that slipped into our last release has
	been fixed. We apologize for the mistake and thank the people
	who reported the problem.

	---

	Noticed CUSTOM_CURSOR is defined in our Cursor dictionary even
	though it doesn't correspond to a real cursor. Happens because
	READCLASS (in YoixModule.java) is asked to load the integers
	defined in java.awt.Cursor class - looks like we need a better
	way for READCLASS to select fields. Need to think about it some.
	A regular expression or a way (perhaps an array of 2 Integers)
	to specify an interval probably would work. Don't get carried
	away on this - CUSTOM_CURSOR may be the only problem and it's
	really not a big deal.

	---

	Made a quick change to POINTER case in YoixObject.cast(). Done
	on 12/15/04 (and modified again on 12/21/04) primarily to help
	with type definitions in a j3d support module that we're still
	working on and will eventually release. Does the CALLABLE case
	deserve similar treatment??

	---

	Changed the implementation of YoixObject.newPointer() that's
	called to handle custom modules so it first looks for a method
	named newObject() and only tries newPointer() when newObject()
	doesn't exist. Done to let custom modules extend YoixObject,
	which will help make other things easier and most consistent.
	Old modules probably should change the name of newPointer() to
	newObject() because it eliminates an extra step. Implementation
	also added at least one new SimpleNode constructor.

    Version 1.2.1 (12/10/04 - external release)
	Added a callback mechanism to the readStream() builtin, which
	is documented in the reference page, and we also improved the
	performance of the low level Java code that readStream() uses.
	The changes mean readStream is a very efficient way to read all
	(or part) of a Yoix stream, like a URL, and the new callback
	mechanism makes it easy to provide progress information to the
	users of an application.

	---

	The Yoix installer finally behaves properly on all supported
	platforms when the name of the installation directory contains
	white space characters (e.g., "Program Files" on Windows).

	---

	In all the older versions of YoixBodyComponentSwing.java and 
	YoixBodyComponentAWT.java event listeners were added near the
	end of the constructors, which sometimes happened after the
	visibility of the window was set to true. The ordering meant
	that there were situations when a windowOpened() event handler
	defined in a Yoix window might not be called. A fairly simple
	rearrangement of the Java code now adds event listeners before
	the window's visibility is set, and that should guarantee that
	a Yoix windowOpened() event handler is always called.

	---

	Removed static from YoixBodyComponentSwing.bg_dummy definition.
	At least one substantial Swing application sometimes had memory
	problems that were tracked down to the fact that bg_dummy was a
	static.

	---

	Added JToggleButton, which is a JButton that behaves like a
	JCheckBox.

	---

	Fixed a low level permissions mistake that caused freopen()
	problems.

	---

	Made a small change to the menu code that tries to prevent a
	separator from being the first entry in a menu. This was added
	rather late, but it's such an innocent change that we really
	don't think anyone will be adversely affected. If you disagree
	send us mail and we will provide a workaround.

	---

	We changed the function dumping code in YoixBodyFunction.java so
	parse tree is dumped when the DEBUG_PARSETREE flag is set. Was
	done while we were debugging a problem and we decided to leave it
	in for now even though we doubt anyone else will use it. There's
	a pretty good chance it either will disappear or be improved in
	our next release.

    Version 1.2.0 (10/27/04 - external release)
	Our Swing support is finally complete and almost all of it has
	now been documented. There undoubtedly are some exceptions, but
	for the most part any Swing class that you might want to use in
	a Java application is available as a Yoix type. In one case,
	namely JOptionPane, we decided that three builtins

		showConfirmDialog()
		showInputDialog()
		showMessageDialog()

	which were added to yoix.swing, would be sufficient, so there's
	no JOptionPane type. Swing components share lots of new fields
	(e.g., preferredsize, size, location, opaque, layer, and showing)
	that are described in the reference pages, so we won't say more
	here - take a look at a simple reference page (e.g., JLabel) and
	you'll get the picture. You'll find other interesting new fields
	(e.g., glasspane, resizable) that are only shared by top level
	application windows (e.g., a JFrame). There's also a new layout
	manager named BoxLayout that works with AWT or Swing components.

	In addition to the standard Swing types we added several that
	can help you convert an AWT application to Swing. For example,
	there's a Yoix type named JChoice even though there's no Java
	class that goes by that name. JScrollbar is another convenient
	addition that's a synonym for JScrollBar (notice the case of the
	'b'), which means you end up with a legitimate Swing scrollbar
	when you add a 'J' to the front of the AWT Scrollbar type.

	We also added builtins named

		getBrighterColor()
		getCMYKColor()
		getDarkerColor()
		getHSBColor()
		getRGBColor()
		getLocationInRoot()
		getLocationOnScreen()

	to yoix.awt and yoix.swing and documented each of them.

	The -g command line option now guarantees that command line and
	and source file information will always be available for error
	reporting. In addition -g now also automatically generates a Yoix
	stack trace when there's an error. Applications started with -g
	pay a penalty when compared to applications started with the -O
	option (they use more memory and are slower), so -g should only
	be used when you need to debug Yoix problems.

	The behavior of -O command line option has not been changed. It
	starts the interpreter running in a way that should result in the
	best performance (e.g., no line number or source file information
	will appear in error messages), but Yoix programs can still make
	changes (e.g., to VM.addtags) that can affect performance. When
	-g and -O appear on the command the last one wins.

	The -I command line option is new and it lets you point at Yoix
	scripts in files that are included after all command line options
	are processed, but before the input file named on the command
	line is executed. Files included this way run in the environment
	created for the primary input file. This option can be particularly
	useful when no input file is named on the command line (i.e., the
	Yoix interpreter reads from standard input) and you want a way to
	establish a consistent environment, often for debugging purposes.
	Multiple -I options are allowed and work as you would expect.

	The -d command line option now interprets a leading 0x to mean
	a hex number and a leading 0 to mean an octal number. See the
	DEBUG_XXX definitions in YoixConstants.java for the current set
	of debug flags. We made a few minor changes to the debug flag
	definitions and added DEBUG_STACKTRACE, which lets you ask for
	a Yoix stack trace when there's an error. Incidentally, command
	line debug flags always end up in VM.debug, which means they can
	be changed by Yoix scripts. For example, something like

		{
		    save VM.debug |= 0x300;	// means trace calls and returns
		    //
		    // Yoix code that you want to trace...
		    //
		    ...
		}

	changes VM.debug so the interpreter traces function calls and
	returns, but using a save statement guarantees that the previous
	value is restored whenever the enclosing block is exited.

	We changed -V option so version information goes to stdout. Also
	-V now just prints the version string - use +V to get a little
	more info. As usual, running programs can find version info in
	VM.Version.

	Incidentally, all command line options are currently documented
	in the comments near the start of YoixMain.java, which you get
	with our source code package. In addition most of them are also
	described in comments in the scripts that our installer leaves
	on your system.

	---

	All of our installers, including the one that we distribute from
	our web site to install the Yoix interpreter, are now executable
	jar files. It's a big improvement that saves space and means your
	browser may know how to install Yoix when you click on the link
	that's used to download the installer. We also followed our own
	advice and converted the installer to Swing, which we think is a
	another big improvement, and made it work on a Mac running OS X.

	---

	The conditional expression operator (i.e., ?:) has finally been
	fixed, so the behavior that you get from the Yoix implementation
	of ?: now does a pretty good job matching other languages. Most
	of the trouble happened because we tried to make ? and : behave
	as special binary operators that the interpreter grouped into a
	traditional ?:  (or non-traditional :?) when possible. It never
	completely worked and ? and : weren't useful binary operators,
	so our attempt at generality didn't add anything useful and left
	us with a confusing ?: operator that sometimes didn't behave the
	way you expected.

	Our fix eliminated ? and : as binary operators (we really doubt
	anyone found them useful) and :? as a non-traditional conditional
	expression. As a result there's a small chance this version of
	the interpreter will complain about syntax errors in scripts that
	worked in our previous releases.

	---

	The interpreter now accepts

	    import yoix.*.*;

	which means you're asking for access to all the modules that are
	loaded into the yoix dictionary when the interpreter boots (the
	list is complied into the interpreter so it doesn't change). The
	new import statement can be a convenient one-line replacement for
	long lists of imports. We use it most of the time now so you'll
	see it in many of our examples.

	Part of the implementation of the new import statement was the
	addition of an array named importdict to the global context. It's
	a read-only array that's used to keep track of the dictionaries
	that have been imported by Yoix statements that end in '.*', like

	    import yoix.xxx.*;

	or

	    import yoix.*.*;

	NOTE - an application that happened to define importdict in the
	global context (we doubt there were any) will have to be changed
	before it will work using this version of the interpreter.

	---

	You can now use a Menu (which really is just an Array with a magic
	type name) to initialize items in a MenuBar, PopupMenu, JMenuBar,
	JPopupMenu, and JMenu. The change simplifies the job of converting
	an AWT application to Swing. We also modified the Java code that
	parses Menus (i.e., the code that runs when a Menu is assigned to
	items) so it accepts an Array or a Menu whenever it wants to find
	the description of a submenu. We also now accept an Array, a Menu,
	or NULL as the first (and only) element in the description of a
	menu item.

	Remember, a Menu isn't the AWT version of a JMenu, so don't change
	Menu to JMenu when you convert an AWT application to Swing!!

	---

	Types that define an insets field (e.g., GridBagConstraints or
	Border) now let you assign a number to that field when all you
	want is a uniform margin. For example,

		BevelBorder bb1 = {
		    Insets insets = {
			int top = 12;
			int left = 12;
			int bottom = 12;
			int right = 12;
		    };
		};

	and

		BevelBorder bb2 = {
		    int insets = 12;
		};

	both work and describe identical borders.

	---

	We now try really hard to give the focus to the last component
	in a window's layout array that explicitly requests the focus
	by setting its requestfocus field to TRUE. Done the first time
	the window is shown or whenever the layout array is changed.

	---

	We made some improvements to the badcall and badargument error
	messages and we now guarantee that both only happen in builtin
	or function calls. The changes forced us to take a careful look
	at our low level function code, and we ended up making several
	changes that make function calls a little bit faster.

	---

	A Yoix JWindow or Window can now get the focus, which means you
	can put a component like a TextArea in a Window and type text
	into that TextArea. The implementation was tricky so there's a
	chance it won't always work - Java didn't make it particularly
	easy.

	---

	The exitflag field that was defined in the VM dictionary has
	been renamed exitmodel. The behavior controlled by exitmodel
	has not changed - allowed values are  0, 1 (default), or 2,
	and they still control what happens when the main thread quits.
	See the comments in YoixMain.java for more details.

	---

	The newline() function supported by TextTerm and JTextTerm is
	now named afterNewline(). Applications that used newline() (we
	doubt there were any) will have to be changed before they will
	work with this release.

	---

	Several special purpose builtins

		yoix.io.readInto()
		yoix.io.writeInto()
		yoix.system.getModuleCreated()
		yoix.system.getModuleNotice()
		yoix.system.getModuleVersion()

	have not been documented yet and extra arguments that we added
	to htoa() and urlDecode() are also undocumented. A small special
	purpose parser, namely PatternParser.jjt, was also added for an
	existing project, but it has not been documented yet.

	=== Java Code Changes ===

	We changed the argument order in put() and declare() methods
	in YoixObject.java and all other classes that implement the
	YoixInterfacePointer interface. Done mostly so the argument
	order matches the put method defined in a Java HashMap and
	the set method defined in Java ArrayList. This change does
	not affect Yoix applications, but it will make a difference
	if you were using the Yoix source code from an older release.

	---

	We made lots of changes to the module loading code. Perhaps
	most important is the removal of the DEST column (it was the
	fifth of the six columns in old tables). The smaller tables
	means modules use less memory and load a little faster. Look
	through YoixModule.java if you're interested in the low level
	module loading code.

	---

	We reorganized this YoixVM.java a bit, mostly by separating
	the error handling and stack support code out into their own
	files, which means you now look in YoixVMError.java for the
	error code and YoixVMStack.java for the stack support code.
	The changes were purely cosmetic (notice that YoixVM extends
	YoixVMStack and that YoixVMStack extends YoixVMError), but
	we think it's a small improvement.

	---

	We now use a special class named YoixVMDisposer to handle all
	Window disposing. Done because Java's Window.dispose() method
	uses invokeAndWait() when dispose() is invoked from a thread
	that isn't the event dispatch thread. Interrupt or stop that
	thread and you may get an unwanted Java dump, and we suppose
	there's even a chance the dispose() won't happen. Anyway, as
	a precaution we now use YoixVMDisposer.

	---

	We added an equals() method to the YoixObject class that is
	currently used by one important custom module. Probably need
	to take one more careful look, because we're currently using
	the "===" variation.

	---

	Changed VM.canExit() slightly so now it asks YoixMain if it's
	OK before exiting. Means the main thread really gets a chance
	to finish.

	---

	The version of YoixObject.newPointer() that gets called from
	YoixMake.yoixType() with a non-NULL classname did VM.pushError()
	but forgot the matching VM.popError(). The mistake only affected
	user modules that defined type templates that defined N_CLASSNAME,
	so the omission only caused occasional (very obscure) problems.

	---

	Changed quite a few uses of Hashtable to HashMap, which helped
	performance. We haven't looked at all Hashtable uses in our Java
	code and can't just blindly convert because the synchronization
	provided by a Hashtable could be important. Same comments apply
	to Vector and ArrayList, which are a little bit harder to convert
	because some method names also need to change.

	---

	Added some simple number caching to YoixObject.java. Seems to
	help performance and usually should help memory usage, but we
	haven't verified that one yet. We don't expect problems, but
	the stuff should be very easy to back out.

	---

	We modified YoixMake.initializer() so it now accepts an array
	of strings, or a comma separated list of strings enclosed in
	braces when a string, which currently must have a well defined
	length, is created either in a declaration or using new. This
	turns out to be an efficient way to concatenate strings, but
	the current restrictions (e.g., the length of the string must
	be specified) make it less useful than you might expect.

	NOTE - this is now be used by an important project, so be very
	careful if you try to change or improve the implementation. We
	undoubtedly will try to make this more general, but remember
	you can always use the + operator to concatenate strings. This
	method happens to be a little more efficient.

	---

	The low level Java code for Swing and AWT components now uses a
	magic field named menumodel (if it happens to be defined in the
	component that's listening for ItemEvents) to decide how to handle
	checkbox or radio buttons that are grouped in a menu. The default
	behavior used when there's no menumodel defined in the component
	is determined by VM.menumodel, which is currently set to 1. That
	means ItemEvents for deselection in a menu item that's also in a
	menu group won't get passed on to a Yoix itemStateChanged() event
	handler that's associated with the menu item. Setting VM.menumodel
	to 0 means raw mode and all ItemEvents that get to the interpreter
	are handed to the Yoix itemStateChanged() event handlers (if there
	is one).

	NOTE - menumodel currently only affects menu items, and only when
	they also happen to be grouped together.

	---

	Added code to YoixBodyComponent.windowClosing() that checks the
	return value of the Yoix event handler, if one was defined. Usual
	system cleanup (i.e., disposing window and checking to see if the
	interpreter can exit) is performed when no Yoix windowClosing()
	event handler is defined or when the Yoix windowClosing() function
	returns FALSE (i.e., 0). This really should be documented!!

	NOTE - the behavior was chosen to match mouse event handlers in a
	TableManager, which was a change we added (but didn't document) in
	release 0.9.3 (check README.old file for more info). Means there's
	at least one important AWT based application that probably relies
	on this behavior.

	=== TODO List ===

	Would it be worth changing the open() builtin slightly so it
	automatically creates a StringStream when handed a pointer to
	a string? Sounds easy and reasonable - later.

	---

	Should strsplit() accept a regular expression? Also, should we
	accept an argument (a string or maybe an array of strings) that
	specifies strings to toss?? For example, we often may want to
	toss empty strings, which show up when delimiters appear next
	to each other? Possible alternative might be regsplit()??

	---

	Reading text from a JTable doesn't capture any editing changes.
	Inconvenient and unfriendly - investigate later.

	---

	Investigate using java.io.File.createTempFile() to implement the
	tmpfile() builtin.

	---

	Looks like some fields (e.g., preferredsize) may be defined in
	Module files but not implemented or used. For example, an AWT
	Frame defines preferredsize, YoixAWTFrame.java tries to use it,
	it's not mentioned in the Frame reference page, and there's a
	decent chance it has no affect on Frames, even when set by user
	code. Eventually investigate and clean this up.

	---

	The low level code that implements scanf() may not be completely
	thread safe because it uses YoixBodyStream.getChar(), which isn't
	synchronized - investigate. This is an old item!!

	---

	Currently get a FatalError, without any useful information, when
	the interpreter encounters EOF in a comment. Seems like we could
	do much better. This is an old item!!

	---

	Java 1.3.1 and later define new modifier flags - check them out
	and probably add them to the modifiers defined in yoix.awt and
	yoix.swing. Probably also need to look at cookModifiers() code.
	Actually think extended modifiers appeared in 1.4.1, which we
	don't currently require, so this one will have to wait.

    Version 1.1.0a (5/31/03 - external release)
	There's a chance we may not be handing spaces in pathnames
	quite right in the scripts that the installer builds on a
	Windows platform. Might be spaces in the jar file pathname
	or maybe in the existing CLASSPATH - investigate. This came
	up when John had to help Lisa with her installed version of
	Yoix.

	---

	Fixed a simple mistake in our low Java code that prevented
	JFrame and JDialog titles from being set.

	---

	Low level code in YoixInterruptable.java that we designed to
	provide interruptible IO was added in release 0.9.4 and has
	always used a support thread to handle IO operations, like
	SeverSocket.accept() or URLConnection.getInputStream(), that
	could cause problems. Part of our cleanup strategy when the
	operation completed or was interrupted called Thread.stop()
	(which we know is deprecated) when it looked like the support
	thread was still running. However the checks that we ran on
	some platforms (e.g., Linux using Java 1.4.X) often made us
	believe the support thread was still running and needed to
	be stopped. The resulting stop() calls in YoixInterruptable,
	which were usually unnecessary, could cause slow performance
	or hangs. We've changed the YoixInterruptable checks and we
	now do a much better job determining when stop() is really
	needed, and that has eliminated performance problems that
	stop() sometimes caused.

	NOTE - this is an important fix if you're running on Linux,
	but as far as we know other systems were not affected.

	---

	We added code to the Yoix installer that tries to make sure
	you're using an appropriate version of Java. If things don't
	look right the installer displays a Dialog with error info
	and download instructions and then quits.

	---

	The scripts built and installed by the Yoix installer now
	use "-jar yoix.jar" instead of setting (and clearing) the
	CLASSPATH. In addition they also include -Dyoix.home=...
	in the script command lines, so the yoix.home definition
	is added to Java's system properties. In other words Yoix
	programs started by those scripts can do

		yoix.system.getProperty("yoix.home")

	whenever they want to find out where the Yoix installer
	put things.

	NOTE - the quoting that's done for yoix_exec.bat may need
	to protect entire paths rather than just protecting the
	installation directory. Means the simple quoting approach
	that we added to installer.yx on 3/29/03 may have to be
	modified.

	---

	Changed our low level Java code to make sure JLabels always
	show up, even when they're asked to display text that's NULL
	or the empty string. The best way to make labels disappear,
	at least from our point of view, is to hide them by setting
	visible to FALSE, rather than by storing NULL or the empty
	string in the JLabel.

	---

	Added TreeSelectionEvent, which means a JTree can define
	valueChanged() event handler if if wants to be notified
	whenever its selection state changes. Punted on the code
	(in YoixMake.java) needed to post a TreeSelectionEvent to
	a JTree, at least for now, but we will tackle it in the
	near future. Documentation is also missing.

	---

	Fixed a low level mistake that prevented event handlers,
	like keyPressed(), from receiving events when they were
	added to swing components, like JTextArea, that also had
	internal scrolling support. Also fixed a related mistake
	that caused problems if we tried to post an event to a
	component, like a JTextArea, that had internal scrolling
	support.

	---

	Added deleteText(), insertText(), and replaceText() to the
	AWT and Swing modules. They complement appendText(), which
	is a builtin that's been around for a long time. Still need
	to document and thoroughly test the new builtins. We also
	added optional arguments to appendText() that need to be
	documented. Part of adding the builtins involved rewriting
	much of the low level Java code that supported appendText().

	NOTE - these builtins do not currently (5/29/03) work with
	a JTextPane. See the YoixBodyComponentSwing.replaceText()
	for more info.

	---

	Added -S to the options supported by the interpreter. It
	can be used to install a security manager at startup that
	implements the policies specified by one or more command
	line -S options. For example,

		yoix -S'prompt:file' ...

	prompts with a dialog whenever the Yoix program that you're
	running tries to read, write, delete, or execute a local
	file, while

		yoix -S'prompt:checkRead' ...

	prompts you before Java reads any file (note that checkRead
	is the name of the SecurityManager function that Java calls
	when it needs to get approval before reading a local file).
	The only current documentation is the source code in file
	YoixSecurityPolicy.java.

	---

	Moved the Thread type definition from YoixModuleThread.java
	to YoixModuleVM.java and installed it in typedict when the
	interpreter starts, instead of relying on automatic loading.
	Reason is that we could end up in deadlock when we used the
	new -S to display a prompt dialog. The exact details of the
	deadlock aren't terribly important - it was pretty easy to
	reproduce. Happened when low level Java code decided to call
	checkAccess() from a GUI thread and our implementation of
	that method called YoixMake.yoixThread(t), which trigged a
	load of the thread type in typedict.

	---

	Made a small change to the code that handles KeyEvents in
	YoixMake.yoixEvent() and we now store -1 in keychar when
	key is pressed or released and it doesn't correspond to a
	Unicode character. All previous releases returned 65535,
	which corresponds to Java's KeyEvent.CHAR_UNDEFINED, but
	the behavior was not documented in Yoix and we did not
	define a CHAR_UNDEFINED constant that programs could use.
	Very small chance an existing program could be affected,
	so make sure we test thoroughly. Done on 3/26/03 and we
	didn't run many tests. Alternative solution would be to
	add CHAR_UNDEFINED to yoix.awt and yoix.swing, but that
	seemed like complete overkill. Revisit and document the
	new behavior before our next release!!

	---

	Several strings in YoixModuleIO.java and YoixModuleVM.java
	were defined with $LR__ access, but should have been $RORO.
	The constants included ISO8859_1, UTF8, and the N_NAME and
	N_MODE fields assigned to stdin, stdout, and stderr. The
	mistake has been corrected.

	---

	Added two builtins name viewToModel() and modelToView()
	to JTextArea, JTextField and JTextPane. Both need to be
	documented and modelToView() needs testing!!

	---

	Added YoixSwingHighlighter.java, YoixSwingJTextField.java,
	and YoixSwingJTextArea.java. They were added to help with
	a custom application, but we think they add capabilities
	that may be useful elsewhere. Has not been documented,
	at least right now, but eventually will be. Highlights
	can currently be accessed using the getHightlights() and
	setHighlights() builtins that were added to yoix.swing,
	while some of the low level behavior of highlights can
	be controlled by setting highlightflags, which is a new
	integer field that was added to JTextArea, JTextField,
	and JTextPane components. The bottom 8 or 9 bits are
	currently used, but right now the only documentation is
	the Java code in YoixSwingHighlighter.java.

	---

	Fields named selectionforeground and selectionbackground
	have been added to JTextArea, JTextField, and JTextPane.
	Needs to be documented and tested.

	---

	Added a requestfocusenabled field to all Swing components
	that can explicitly (by storing true in requestfocus) or
	implicitly (e.g., pressing a button when the pointer is
	in the component) request the focus. Setting it to false
	means requests for the focus will be ignored. This field
	should be viewed as a hint that Java may or may not honor,
	however our experience setting requestfocusenabled has
	been very good.

	---

	Added a nextfocus field to all Swing components that can
	explicitly request the focus. The value that is stored in
	nextfocus is the component that gets the focus after this
	one when the focus is changed by the focus traversal keys
	(Tab or Crtl-Tab). Needs to be documented and tested.

	---

	Added a field named insets to JTextArea, JTextField, and
	JTextPane. Still needs to be documented.

	---

	Changed Regexp.bldcclass() so it accepts a dash (i.e., -)
	as the first or last character in a character class.

	---

	Added yoix.system.getModuleVersion() builtin. Not convinced
	it should to be documented - really seems like there should
	be a more general approach.

	---

	Looks like there's a bug in ?: operator. The grouping in
	the parse tree built by YoixParser.jjt for

		0 ? 1 : 2 + 3;

	doesn't look like it matches C because the parser currently
	requires parens around the expression that follows the colon.
	Find a fix, but then think about whether and/or how to put
	it in. The change could easily affect existing applications??

    Version 1.1.0 (1/23/03 - external release)
	Java2D, Swing, and expanded Image support are the main new
	additions. Take a look at the Graphics, Path, Matrix, and
	Font reference pages (and the pages they reference) and you
	will find lots of Java2D examples. Swing component names
	all start with J (e.g., JButton, JFrame) and most of the
	reference pages include examples. The Image reference page
	(and the pages that it references) describe the new Image
	processing builtins that were added in this release as well
	as being a good source of examples.

	---

	Frame, Dialog, Window, Panel, Canvas, and Image are drawable
	objects, which means each one defines fields named graphics
	and paint that can be used to draw on them. The same thing
	holds for the JFrame, JDialog, JWindow, JPanel, and JCanvas
	objects that were added as part of our Swing support. See
	the individual reference pages for more info. The Graphics
	reference page (and the pages that it references) is a good
	source of examples.

	---

	Objects that implement paint() now accept a function that can
	be called with 0 or 1 argument and complain with a typecheck
	error when an invalid function is assigned to paint. Previous
	releases assumed paint functions could be called with exactly
	one argument and only noticed invalid functions when the call
	to paint() was generated.

	---

	Drawable objects now define a repaint() builtin that tells
	the drawable object to completely repaint itself.

	---

	Added a field named coordinates to MouseEvents. It describes
	where the event happened, much like the location field, but
	when a MouseEvent arrives at the handler in a drawable object
	coordinates will always be a point in the coordinate system
	described by the drawable object's graphics.CTM matrix at the
	time the event arrives. In other words, coordinates is often
	used by event handlers that draw in an object, like a Frame
	or a Canvas.

	---

	InvocationEvent is a new event type that Yoix programs can
	send to AWT or Swing components with postEvent(). The event
	triggers a call of the component's invocationRun() event
	handler, if it's defined. As you might expect, the call is
	made from the thread Java is using to dispatch AWT Events.

	---

	This release supports four Swing events, namely CaretEvent,
	ChangeEvent, HyperlinkEvent, and ListSelectionEvent, which
	are described in the reference pages. Future releases will
	support more Swing events.

	---

	The postEvent() builtin can be used to send events through
	Java's AWT EventQueue to any component that Yoix supports.
	There are no restrictions about Swing components or Swing
	events, except that you won't be able to send an event to
	a component that can't officially handle the event. We also
	changed postEvent's behavior slightly and made it return a
	non-zero value if the event was put on AWT event queue. In
	previous releases postEvent aborted with a badargument error,
	but we decided that a return value would be a better way to
	handle queuing errors. See the postEvent reference page for
	more details.

	---

	Added the invokeLater() builtin (available in yoix.awt or
	yoix.swing) that arranges to call a Yoix function after the
	events pending in the Java AWT EventQueue at the time of the
	invokeLater() call are processed. The call is made from the
	thread that Java is using to dispatch Events.

	---

	Added the isDispatchThread() builtin (available in yoix.awt
	or yoix.swing) that returns non-zero value if the calling
	thread is the one used to dispatch AWT events.

	---

	The hints field that was defined in an Image has disappeared.
	Existing applications that were using the Image hints field
	may need to be updated.

	---

	The Image source field can now be a String or another Image.
	Setting it to an Image, which wasn't allowed in our previous
	releases, means make an immediate copy of the source image
	so that both images will be completely independent. Setting
	source to NULL (or "") means build a memory resident image
	that has a size specified by the Image's size field. This is
	a small change from previous releases, which did not build
	a memory resident image when source was NULL.

	---

	The atoh() builtin no longer stops at the first null character,
	which means it does a much better job working with the htoa()
	builtin. In addition htoa, which still stops at the first null
	character, ignores all other characters that don't represent
	hex digits. These changes could impact existing applications,
	but we think they're appropriate - please complain to us if
	you disagree.

	---

	The appendText() builtin, which works for many AWT and Swing
	components that define a field named text, now checks the
	read and write access permission assigned to that field. It
	also returns the length of the text string that was appended
	or -1 if there was an error.

	---

	Fixed an inconsistency in the low level implementation of the
	qsort() builtin so that the sorting when the compare function
	is omitted or supplied as yoix.util.compareTo match as long
	as no elements are NULL. Unfortunately this is a change that
	could affect existing applications.

	---

	The position of the count and callable arguments described in
	the qsort() reference page was incorrect and has been fixed.

	---

	Modified the low level implementation of the qsort() builtin
	in a way that significantly improves performance when lots of
	identical objects are encountered in the array that's being
	sorted.

	---

	The colors (more than 700) defined in the rgb.txt file that's
	part of the X Window System are now available (lower case only)
	in the yoix.xcolor dictionary.

	---

	Constants BOTTOMLEFT, BOTTOMRIGHT, TOPLEFT, and TOPRIGHT are
	now defined in yoix.awt and can be used in place of SOUTHWEST,
	SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, and NORTHEAST. Identical constants are
	defined in yoix.swing and can be used in the same situations
	plus a few.

	---

	The clip entry in a Graphics is now a builtin instead of a
	Rectangle. New model follows PostScript, so the clip builtin
	creates a new clipping path by intersecting the current path
	with the current clipping path. Use initclip first when you
	need to enlarge the clipping path. This is an incompatible
	change, but we seriously doubt anyone was using the old clip
	model.

	---

	Fixed a mistake in the parser related to casts that caused
	simple expressions like,

		x = (int)12.3;

	to fail. This change seems to fix the most annoying cast
	problems, but we still realize there's at least one fairly
	obscure cast related problem that we will try to fix next
	time. This

		x = (int)(12.3 + 4.8);

	works, but put parens around the entire right side and the
	parser gets confused and generates code for a function call.
	We understand what's happening, but don't have a fix that
	we're currently satisfied with.

	---

	Changing an AWT Frame's background or foreground color now
	also tries to affect the frame's menubar, if there is one.
	This change is implemented by removing and reattaching the
	the menubar, which seems to work on some Unix platforms but
	unfortunately not on Windows. We may add a system test and
	leave the menubar alone on systems, like Windows, where the
	background color doesn't change.

	---

	Added an optional alpha argument to the drawString() builtin
	defined in yoix.graphics. We considered adding alpha to other
	yoix.graphics builtins, like drawArc() and fillRect(), but
	decided against it, at least for now. Partially transparent
	shapes can be painted using the fill() and stroke() builtins
	that are defined in Graphics objects.

	---

	The group field in a Checkbox is now active so changing it
	should affect all "related" checkboxes. Setting it to null
	should also remove the checkbox from the group.

	---

	Removed the nextcard field from ScrollPane. It could not be
	used because the layoutmanager is an internal version that
	can't ever be set to CardLayout.

	---

	Fixed an apparent mistake in YoixAWTTextField.java that only
	seemed to cause problems on one platform using a new version
	of Java (e.g., 1.4.1 on Linux). The getMinimumSize() method
	called super.getPreferredSize() and under some circumstances
	that could end up in an infinite loop. Replacing that call
	with super.getMinimumSize() fixed the problem.

	---

	Many entries in typedict were readable and writable in our
	last release. We've fixed the mistake by removing all access
	(except to the name). We're not trying to hide anything (the
	source code is available to anyone), but didn't think Yoix
	programs should change typedict entries or make decisions
	based on the content of a typedict entry.

	---

	We spent some time working on the Yoix module related code
	and made many methods in YoixObject, YoixVM, YoixMisc, and
	YoixMake public so they're available to be used in modules
	that don't belong to the att.research.yoix package. We also
	removed YoixPublic.java and YoixPublicConstants.java, which
	were class files that provided access to some of the methods
	that are now public. Module documentation is still missing,
	but the comments and code in ExampleModule.java should help
	some.

	---

	Added fields named buttonmask and sticky to TextCanvas and
	Canvas objects. buttonmask selects the buttons that trigger
	actionPerformed or itemStateChanged event and sticky controls
	when state is reset to FALSE after an actionPerformed event
	is triggered. Setting sticky to TRUE means the state is not
	reset when an actionPerformed event is triggered, which means
	it must be done somewhere else (e.g., in event handler) before
	another actionPerformed event can be triggered. These fields
	may not be documented in reference pages, which means there
	is no guarantee they will be around in future releases.

	---

	The qsort() builtin in this release accepts a dictionary as
	the compare argument, but it has not been documented here or
	in the reference page, which means there is no guarantee it
	will be accepted in future releases.
